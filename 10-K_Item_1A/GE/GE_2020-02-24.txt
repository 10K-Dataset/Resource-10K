ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

The following discussion of risk factors contains "forward-looking statements," as discussed in the Forward-Looking Statements section. These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Form 10-K report or elsewhere. The risks described below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks that we may face. The following information should be read in conjunction with the MD&A section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks we describe in this Form 10-K report or in our other SEC filings could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations, and they could cause our future results to be materially different than we presently anticipate.

STRATEGIC RISKS

.

Strategic risk relates to the Company's future business plans and strategies, including the risks associated with: the global macro-environment; our portfolio of businesses and capital allocation decisions; dispositions, acquisitions, joint ventures and restructuring activity; competitive threats, the demand for our products and services and the success of our investments in technology and innovation; intellectual property; and other risks

.

Global macro-environment - Our growth is subject to global economic, political and geopolitical risks.

We operate in virtually every part of the world, serve customers in over 170 countries and received 59% of our revenues for 2019 from outside the United States. Our operations and the execution of our business plans and strategies are subject to the effects of global economic trends, competition and geopolitical risks and demand or supply shocks from war, natural disaster, a health pandemic or other events. They are also affected by local and regional economic environments and policies in the U.S. and other markets that we serve, including interest rates, monetary policy, inflation, economic growth, recession, commodity prices, currency volatility, currency controls or other limitations on the ability to expatriate cash, debt levels and actual or anticipated defaults on sovereign debt. For example, changes in local economic conditions or outlooks, such as lower rates of investment or economic growth in China, Europe or other key markets, affect the demand for or profitability of our products and services outside the U.S., and the impact on the Company could be significant given the extent of our activities outside the United States. Political changes and trends such as populism, protectionism, economic nationalism and sentiment toward multinational companies and resulting changes to trade, tax or other laws and policies (including tariffs) have been and may continue to be disruptive and costly to our businesses, and can interfere with our global operating model, supply chain, production costs, customer relationships and competitive position. Further escalation of specific trade tensions, such as those between the U.S. and China, or in global trade conflict more broadly could lead to a significant deterioration of global growth, and related decreases in confidence or investment activity in the global markets would adversely affect our business performance. We also do business in many emerging market jurisdictions where economic, political and legal risks are heightened. While some types of these economic risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial instruments and some are insurable, such attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful

.




RISK FACTORS

Portfolio strategy execution - Our success depends on achieving our strategic and financial objectives, including through dispositions.

We are pursuing a variety of dispositions, including the planned sale of our BioPharma business within our Healthcare segment and exiting our remaining equity ownership position in Baker Hughes. The proceeds that we expect to receive from such actions are an important source of cash flow for the Company as part of our strategic and financial planning. As we seek to sell certain businesses, equity interests or assets, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers, managing interdependencies across multiple transactions and other Company initiatives or implementing separation plans, which could delay or prevent the accomplishment of our strategic and financial objectives, including our goal of reducing the Company’s leverage to targeted levels over time. In particular, some of the disposition strategies that we are considering or may consider depend on favorable conditions in the capital markets or private acquisition financing markets for execution, and declines in the values of equity interests (such as our remaining interest in Baker Hughes) or other assets that we sell can diminish the cash proceeds that we realize. We may dispose of businesses or assets at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated, or with purchase price adjustments or the exclusion of assets or liabilities that must be divested, managed or run off separately. We are also subject to limitations in the form of regulatory or governmental approvals that may prevent certain prospective purchasers from completing transactions with us or delay us from executing transactions on our preferred timeline, or arising from our debt or other contractual obligations that limit our ability to complete certain business or asset dispositions. Moreover, recent and planned dispositions have the effects of reducing the Company’s cash flow and earnings capacity, resulting in a less diversified portfolio of businesses and increasing our dependency on remaining businesses for our financial results from ongoing operations. Executing on these transactions can divert senior management time and resources from other pursuits. Dispositions or other business separations also often involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, retained assets or liabilities, transition services agreements, commercial agreements, guarantees, indemnities or other current or contingent financial obligations or liabilities. Under these arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside our control could materially affect our future financial results.

With respect to acquisitions, joint ventures and business integrations, we may not achieve expected returns and other benefits as a result of changes in strategy or separation/integration challenges related to personnel, IT systems or other factors. In addition, in connection with acquisitions over time, we have recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet, and if we are not able to realize the value of these assets, we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment of these assets. We also participate in a number of joint ventures with other companies or government enterprises in various markets around the world, including joint ventures where we have a lesser degree of control over the business operations, which may expose us to additional operational, financial, legal or compliance risks

.

Competitive environment - We are dependent on the maintenance of existing product lines and service relationships, market acceptance of new product and service introductions and technology and innovation leadership for revenue and earnings growth.

The markets in which we operate are highly competitive in terms of pricing, product and service quality, product development and introduction time, customer service, financing terms and shifts in market demand, and competitors are increasingly offering services for our installed base. Our long-term operating results and competitive position depend substantially upon our ability to continually develop, introduce, and market new and innovative products, services and platforms, to modify existing products and services, to customize products and services, to increase our productivity as we perform on long-term service agreements, and to anticipate and respond to market and technological changes driven by trends such as increased digitization or automation or by developments such as climate change that present both risks and opportunities for our businesses. A failure to appropriately plan for future customer demand and industry trends may adversely affect our delivery of products, services and outcomes in line with our projected financial performance or cost estimates, and ultimately may result in excess costs, build-up of inventory that becomes obsolete, lower profit margins and an erosion of our competitive position. For example, the significant decreases in recent years in the levelized cost of renewable sources of power generation (such as wind and solar), along with ongoing changes in investor and consumer preferences and considerations related to climate change, affect the demand for and the competitiveness of our products and services related to fossil fuel-based power generation and further changes over time could have a material adverse effect on the performance of those businesses and our consolidated results. These trends and the relative competitiveness of different types of product and service offerings will continue to be impacted in ways that are uncertain by factors such as the pace of technological developments and related cost considerations, the levels of economic growth in different markets around the world and the adoption of climate change-related policies (such as carbon taxes, cap and trade regimes, increased efficiency standards or incentives or mandates for particular types of energy) at the national and sub-national levels or by private actors.

Our businesses are also subject to technological change and require us to continually attract and retain skilled talent. The introduction of innovative and disruptive technologies in the markets in which we operate also poses risks in the form of new competitors (including new entrants from outside our traditional industries), market consolidation, substitutions of existing products, services or solutions, niche players, new business models and competitors that are faster to market with new or more cost-effective products or services. Because the research and development cycle involved in bringing products in our businesses to market is often lengthy, it is inherently difficult to predict the economic conditions and competitive dynamics that will exist when any new product is complete, and our investments may generate weaker returns than we anticipated at the outset. Our capacity to invest in research and development efforts to pursue advancement in a wide range of technologies, products and services also depends on the financial resources that we have available for such investment relative to other capital allocation priorities, and under-investment could lead to the loss of sales of our products and services. The amounts that we do invest in research and development divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and our efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings.




RISK FACTORS

Restructuring & personnel -

We have been undertaking extensive cost reduction and restructuring efforts; these efforts may have adverse effects on our operations, employee retention, results and reputation and may not achieve the expected benefits

.

We continue undertaking restructuring actions that include workforce reductions, global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives. These actions are a central component of our ongoing efforts to improve operational and financial performance. The extent of change across our organizational structure, senior leadership, culture, functional alignment, outsourcing and other areas poses risks in the form of personnel capacity constraints and institutional knowledge loss that could lead to missed performance or financial targets, loss of key personnel and harm to our reputation. The risk of capacity constraints is also heightened with the number of interdependent and transformational business portfolio and internal actions that we have been undertaking during a period of significant restructuring and cost reduction across the Company. Moreover, if we do not successfully manage our restructuring and other transformational activities, the anticipated operational improvements, efficiencies and other benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted. Risks associated with these actions include unforeseen delays in implementation of workforce reductions, additional unexpected costs, adverse effects on employee morale, loss of key employees or other retention issues, inability to attract and hire talented professionals or the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or work stoppages, any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm our business or reputation and have an adverse effect on our competitive position or financial performance

.

Intellectual property - Our intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to ours, and the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted by external dependencies.

Our patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing or selling products and services similar to or duplicative of ours, and there can be no assurance that the resources invested by us to protect our intellectual property will be sufficient or that our intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of our technology. Trademark licenses of the GE brand in connection with dispositions may negatively impact the overall value of the brand in the future. As a result of increased numbers of employee exits due to restructuring activities or otherwise, we also face heightened risks related to the loss or unauthorized use of the Company’s intellectual property or other protected data. We also face competition in some countries where we have not invested in an intellectual property portfolio. If we are not able to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected. We also face attempts to gain unauthorized access to our IT systems or products for the purpose of improperly acquiring our trade secrets or confidential business information. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position and the value of our investment in research and development. In addition, we are subject to the enforcement of patents or other intellectual property by third parties, including aggressive and opportunistic enforcement claims by non-practicing entities. Regardless of the merit of such claims, responding to infringement claims can be expensive and time-consuming. If GE is found to infringe any third-party rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages or we could be enjoined from offering some of our products and services. The value of, or our ability to use, our intellectual property may also be negatively impacted by dependencies on third parties, such as our ability to obtain or renew on reasonable terms licenses that we need in the future, or our ability to secure or retain ownership or rights to use data in certain software analytics or services offering

s.

OPERATIONAL RISKS.

Operational risk relates to risks arising from systems, processes, people and external events that affect the operation of our businesses. It includes risks related to product and service lifecycle and execution; product safety and performance; information management and data protection and security, including cybersecurity; and supply chain and business disruption.

Operational execution - Operational challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations.

The Company’s financial results depend on the successful execution of our businesses’ operating plans across all steps of the product and service lifecycle. For example, we continue working to improve the operations and execution of our Power and Renewable Energy businesses, and our ability to effect the desired operational turnarounds will be a significant factor in determining the financial performance of the Company as a whole. In addition, we have dependency on the continued strength and successful operating plan execution of our other businesses, particularly Aviation, during this period of operational improvement. Operational failures that result in quality problems or potential product, environmental, health or safety risks, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations. In addition, a portion of our business, particularly within our Power and Renewable Energy businesses, involves large projects where we take on, or are members of a consortium responsible for, the full scope of engineering, procurement, construction or other services. These types of projects often pose unique risks related to their location, scale, complexity, duration and pricing or payment structure. Performance issues or schedule delays can arise due to inadequate technical expertise, unanticipated project modifications, developments at project sites, environmental, health and safety issues, execution by or coordination with suppliers, subcontractors or consortium partners, financial difficulties of our customers or significant partners or compliance with government regulations, and these can lead to cost overruns, contractual penalties, liquidated damages and other adverse consequences. Where GE is a member of a consortium, we are typically subject to claims based on joint and several liability, and claims can extend to aspects of the project or costs that are not directly related or limited to GE’s scope of work. Operational, quality or other issues at large projects, or across our projects portfolio more broadly, can adversely affect GE’s business, reputation or results of operations

.




RISK FACTORS

Product safety - Our products and services are highly sophisticated and specialized, and a major failure or similar event affecting our products or third-party products with which our products are integrated can adversely affect our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations.

We produce highly sophisticated products and provide specialized services for both our own and third-party products that incorporate or use complex or leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software. Many of our products and services involve complex industrial machinery or infrastructure projects, such as commercial jet engines, gas turbines, onshore and offshore wind turbines or nuclear power generation, and accordingly the impact of a catastrophic product failure or similar event could be significant. In particular, actual or perceived design or production issues related to new product introductions or relatively new product lines can result in significant reputational harm to our businesses, in addition to direct warranty, maintenance and other costs that may arise. A significant product issue resulting in injuries or death, widespread outages, a fleet grounding or similar systemic consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations. We may also incur increased costs, delayed payments or lost equipment or services revenue in connection with a significant issue with a third party’s product with which our products are integrated. For example, the LEAP-1B engine that our Aviation business develops, produces and sells through CFM is the exclusive engine for the Boeing 737 MAX, which has been subject to a global fleet grounding since March 2019 following two fatal crashes that were unrelated to the LEAP engine. The 737 MAX grounding had an adverse effect on GE CFOA in 2019, and uncertainties related to the timing for the 737 MAX return to service and future engine production rates pose material risk for our Aviation business and GE’s overall financial outlook and results. For further information regarding the effect of the 737 MAX grounding on GE CFOA, see the Aviation and GECAS 737 MAX section in Consolidated Results within MD&A. While we have built operational processes to ensure that our product design, manufacture, performance and servicing meet rigorous quality standards, there can be no assurance that we or our customers or other third parties will not experience operational process or product failures and other problems, including through manufacturing or design defects, process or other failures of contractors or third-party suppliers, cyber-attacks or other intentional acts, that could result in potential product, safety, quality, regulatory or environmental risks.

Cybersecurity - Increased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions, services and data.

Increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats, computer viruses and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks, as well as cybersecurity failures resulting from human error and technological errors, pose a risk to the security of GE's and its customers', partners', suppliers' and third-party service providers' infrastructure, products, systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of GE's and its customers' data. As the perpetrators of such attacks become more capable (including sophisticated state or state-affiliated actors), and as critical infrastructure is increasingly becoming digitized, the risks in this area continue to grow. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, monitoring and testing, and maintenance of protective systems and contingency plans, we remain vulnerable to known or unknown threats, and there is no assurance that the impact from such threats will not be material. In addition to existing risks, the adoption of new technologies in the future may also increase our exposure to cybersecurity breaches and failures. We also have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations or customer-imposed controls. Despite our use of reasonable and appropriate controls to protect our systems and sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, we have vulnerability to security breaches, theft, misplaced, lost or corrupted data, programming errors, employee errors and/or malfeasance (including misappropriation by departing employees) that could potentially lead to material compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions. Data privacy and protection laws are evolving, can vary significantly by country and present increasing compliance challenges, which increase our costs, affect our competitiveness and can expose us to substantial fines or other penalties. In addition, a significant cyber-related attack could result in other negative consequences, including damage to our reputation or competitiveness, remediation or increased protection costs, litigation or regulatory action.

Supply chain - Significant raw material shortages, supplier capacity constraints, supplier or customer production disruptions, supplier quality and sourcing issues or price increases can increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products.

Our reliance on third-party suppliers, contract manufacturers and service providers, and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials, parts, components, systems and services. As our supply chains extend into many different countries and regions around the world, we are also subject to global economic and geopolitical dynamics and risks associated with exporting components manufactured in particular countries for incorporation into finished products completed in other countries. In addition, some of our suppliers or their sub-suppliers are limited- or sole-source suppliers. We also have internal dependencies on certain key GE manufacturing or other facilities. Disruptions in deliveries from a key GE facility or from our third-party suppliers, contract manufacturers or outsourced or other service providers, capacity constraints, production disruptions up- or down-stream, price increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities, including as a result of war, natural disaster, health pandemic or other business continuity events, adversely affect our operations and, depending on the length and severity of the disruption, can limit our ability to meet our commitments to customers or significantly impact our operating profit or cash flows. For example, we are monitoring the impact across our businesses of the recent coronavirus outbreak, which has already caused disruption to production facilities and activities in China, and the severity of the operational and financial impact will depend on how long and widespread the disruption proves to be. Quality, capability, compliance and sourcing issues experienced by third-party providers can also adversely affect our costs, margin rates and the quality and effectiveness of our products and services and result in liability and reputational harm. In addition, while we require our suppliers to implement and maintain reasonable and appropriate controls to protect information we provide to them, they may be the victim of a cyber-related attack that could lead to the compromise of the Company’s intellectual property, personal data or other confidential information, or to production downtimes and operational disruptions that could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers

.




RISK FACTORS

FINANCIAL RISKS.

Financial risk relates to our ability to meet financial obligations and mitigate exposure to broad market risks, including funding and liquidity risks, such as risk related to our credit ratings and our availability and cost of funding; credit risk; and volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Liquidity risk refers to the potential inability to meet contractual or contingent financial obligations (whether on- or off-balance sheet) as they arise, and could potentially impact an institution's financial condition or overall safety and soundness. Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from a customer or counterparty failure to meet its contractual obligations, and we face credit risk arising from both our industrial businesses and from GE Capital.

Leverage & borrowings - Our indebtedness levels could limit the flexibility of our businesses, and we could face further constraints as a result of failing to decrease our leverage over time, further downgrades of our credit ratings or adverse market conditions.

Our ability to decrease our leverage as planned is dependent on the proceeds that we generate from business and asset dispositions, as well as our cash flows from operations. De-leveraging and servicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash, and if we are unable to generate cash flows in accordance with our plans we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as increasing borrowing under credit lines, further reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling other businesses or assets, refinancing debt or raising additional equity capital. In particular,

we have significant pension and run-off insurance liabilities that are sensitive to numerous factors and assumptions that we use in our pension liability, GAAP insurance reserve and insurance statutory calculations. For example, the impact of low or declining market interest rates on the discount rates that we use to calculate these long-term liabilities (holding other variables constant) can adversely affect our earnings and cash flows, as well as the pace of progress toward our leverage goals for GE and for GE Capital. Lower than expected disposition proceeds or cash generation by our businesses over time could also adversely affect our progress toward our leverage goals.

Our indebtedness could put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with lower debt levels that may have greater financial flexibility to secure additional funding for their operations, pursue strategic acquisitions, finance long-term projects or take other actions. Continuing to have substantial indebtedness could also have the consequence of increasing our vulnerability to general economic conditions, such as slowing economic growth or recession. It could also increase our vulnerability to adverse industry-specific conditions or to increases in the capital or liquidity needs at the GE or GE Capital levels, and it could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the economy and the industries in which we compete.

In addition, our existing levels of indebtedness may impair our ability to obtain additional debt financing on favorable terms in the future, particularly if coupled with further downgrades of our credit ratings or a deterioration of capital markets conditions more generally. External conditions in the financial and credit markets may limit the availability of funding at particular times or increase the cost of funding, which could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. Factors that may affect the availability of funding or cause an increase in our funding costs include market disruptions arising in the United States, Europe, China, emerging markets or other markets, currency movements or other factors.

Liquidity - Failure to meet our cash flow targets, or additional credit downgrades, could adversely affect our liquidity, funding costs and related margins.

We rely on cash from operations and proceeds from business and asset dispositions, as well as access to the short- and long-term debt markets, to fund our operations, maintain a contingency buffer of liquidity and meet our financial obligations and capital allocation priorities. If we do not meet our cash flow objectives, through both improved cash performance in our businesses or successful execution of business and asset dispositions, our financial condition could be adversely affected. Our access to the debt markets, and to the commercial paper markets in particular, depends on our credit ratings. As a result of ratings actions by Moody’s, S&P and Fitch in 2018, GE transitioned to a tier-2 commercial paper issuer, which reduced our borrowing capacity in the commercial paper markets that we historically relied on significantly to fund our operations on an intra-quarter basis. To accommodate GE’s short-term liquidity needs, we have been increasing utilization of our revolving credit facilities as a substitute for commercial paper borrowings, which results in an overall increase to our cost of funds.




RISK FACTORS

There can also be no assurance that we will not face additional credit downgrades as a result of factors such as our progress in decreasing our leverage, the performance of our businesses, the failure to execute on dispositions or changes in rating application or methodology. Future downgrades could further adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets, and a significant downgrade could have an adverse commercial impact on our industrial businesses. For example, if our short-term credit ratings were to fall below A-2/P-2/F2, it is possible that we would lose all or part of our access to the tier-2 commercial paper markets, and therefore our borrowing capacity in the commercial paper markets would likely be further reduced. Further, we have relied, and may continue to rely, on securitization programs to provide alternative funding for sales of GE receivables to third-party investors. If any of our short-term credit ratings were to fall below A-2/P-2/F2, the timing or amount of liquidity generated by these programs could be adversely affected. In addition, in certain securitization transactions where we provide servicing for third-party investors, we are contractually permitted to commingle cash collected from customers on financing receivables sold or pledged to third-party investors with our own cash prior to making required payments to third-party investors, provided our short-term credit rating does not fall below A-2/P-2/F2. In the event our ratings were to fall below such levels, we would be required to segregate certain of these cash collections owed to third-party investors into restricted bank accounts and would lose the short-term liquidity benefit of commingling with respect to such collections. In addition, under various debt and derivative instruments, guarantees and covenants, we could be required to post additional capital or collateral in the event of a ratings downgrade, which would increase the impact of a ratings downgrade on our liquidity and capital position. Swap, forward and option contracts are executed under standard master agreements that typically contain mutual downgrade provisions that provide the ability of the counterparty to require termination if the credit ratings of the applicable GE entity were to fall below specified ratings levels agreed upon with the counterparty, primarily BBB/Baa2. For additional discussion about our current credit ratings and related considerations, refer to the Capital Resources and Liquidity - Credit Ratings and Conditions section within MD&A

.

Economy, customers & counterparties - Deterioration in conditions in the global economy, the major industries we serve or the financial markets, or in the soundness of financial institutions, governments or customers we deal with, can adversely affect our business and results of operations.

The business and operating results of our industrial businesses have been, and will continue to be, affected by worldwide economic conditions, including conditions in the air transportation, power generation, renewable energy, healthcare and other industries we serve. Existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and services, including large infrastructure projects, and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion as a result of business deterioration, cash flow shortages or difficulty obtaining financing for particular projects or due to macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical disruptions, changes in law or other challenges affecting the strength of the global economy. The airline industry, for example, is highly cyclical, and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the U.S. and international economies. An extended disruption of regional or international travel, such as a disruption in connection with a terrorist incident, health pandemic or recessionary economic environment that results in the loss of business and leisure traffic, could have a material adverse effect on our airline customers, the viability of their business and their demand for our products and services. Such effects would be particularly significant for GE in the current environment, in which we have dependency on the continued strength of our Aviation business as we execute on planned dispositions and continue working to improve the operations and execution of other GE businesses. Secular, cyclical and competitive pressures facing customers across our energy businesses can also have a significant impact on the operating results and outlooks for our businesses.  These include pressures such as lower demand in our Power business than in the past as a result of increased cost competitiveness and market penetration by renewable sources of power generation; the effects of changes in production or other tax credits for wind energy projects, and significant price competition among wind equipment manufacturers and consolidation in the industry; and shifts in the availability of financing for certain types of projects as investors, governments, regulators and other market participants develop plans for addressing climate change. In particular, our ability to effect an operational turnaround in our Power business will be more challenging to the extent that markets for our products and services remain lower for longer than expected. Further, our vendors may experience similar conditions, which may impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us. We also at times face greater challenges collecting on receivables with customers that are sovereign governments or located in emerging markets. If there is significant deterioration in the global economy, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected

.




RISK FACTORS

GE Capital - A smaller GE Capital continues to have exposure to insurance, credit and other risks and, in the event of future adverse developments, may not be able to meet its business and financial objectives without further actions at GE Capital or additional capital contributions by GE

.

To fund the statutory capital contributions that it expects to make to its insurance subsidiaries over the next several years, as well as to meet its debt maturities and other obligations, GE Capital expects to rely on its existing liquidity, cash generated from asset reductions, cash flows from its businesses, GE repayments of intercompany loans and capital contributions from GE. However, as GE Capital’s excess liquidity from past disposition proceeds runs off, and as its future earnings are reduced as a result of business and asset sales, there is a risk that future adverse developments could cause liquidity or funding stress for GE Capital. For example, it is possible that future requirements for capital contributions to the insurance subsidiaries will be greater than currently estimated or could be accelerated by regulators. Our annual testing of insurance reserves is subject to a variety of assumptions, including assumptions about the discount rate (which is sensitive to changes in market interest rates), morbidity, mortality and future long-term care premium increases. Any future adverse changes to these assumptions (to the extent not offset by any favorable changes to these assumptions) could result in an increase to future policy benefit reserves and, potentially, to the amount of capital we are required to contribute to the insurance subsidiaries (as discussed in the Other Items - Insurance section within MD&A). We also anticipate that the new insurance accounting standard scheduled to be effective after 2021 (as discussed in the Other Items - New Accounting Standards section within MD&A) will significantly change the accounting for measurements of our long-duration insurance liabilities under GAAP and will materially affect our financial statements. In addition, we continue to evaluate strategic options to accelerate the further reduction in the size of GE Capital. Some of these options could have a material financial charge depending on the timing, negotiated terms and conditions of any ultimate arrangements. It is also possible that contingent liabilities and loss estimates from GE Capital’s continuing or discontinued operations (see the Other Consolidated Information - Discontinued Operations section within MD&A) will need to be recognized or increase in the future and will become payable. If GE Capital's credit ratings are downgraded because of inadequate increases in its capital levels over time, changes in rating application or methodology or other factors, GE Capital may also face increased interest costs and limitations on its ability to access external funding in the future.

GE Capital also has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, including sovereign governments, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose GE Capital to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client. If conditions in the financial markets deteriorate, they may adversely affect the business and results of operations of GE Capital, as well as the soundness of financial institutions, governments and other counterparties we deal with. There can be no assurance that future liabilities, losses or impairments to the carrying value of financial assets would not materially and adversely affect GE Capital's business, financial position, results of operations and capacity to provide financing to support orders from GE's industrial businesses, or that factors causing sufficiently severe stress at GE Capital would not require GE to make larger than expected capital contributions to GE Capital in the future.

Postretirement benefit plans - Increases in pension and healthcare benefits obligations and costs can adversely affect our earnings

,

cash flows and progress toward our leverage goals

.

Our results of operations may be positively or negatively affected by the amount of income or expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans. GAAP requires that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations, which reflect assumptions about financial markets, interest rates and other economic conditions such as the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. We are also required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant reduction or increase to equity. The factors that impact our pension calculations are subject to changes in key economic indicators, and future decreases in the discount rate or low returns on plan assets can increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial results. In addition, although GAAP expense and pension funding contributions are not directly related, key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash we would be required to contribute to pension plans under ERISA. Failure to achieve expected returns on plan assets driven by various factors, which could include a continued environment of low interest rates or sustained market volatility, could also result in an increase to the amount of cash we would be required to contribute to pension plans. In addition, there may be upward pressure on the cost of providing healthcare benefits to current employees and retirees. Although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure could reduce our profitability. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements have been and can be affected by our pension and healthcare benefit obligations, see the Other Consolidated Information - Postretirement Benefit Plans and the Critical Accounting Estimates - Pension Assumptions sections within MD&A and Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements

.




RISK FACTORS

LEGAL & COMPLIANCE RISKS.

Legal and compliance risk relates to risks arising from the government and regulatory environment and action and from legal proceedings and compliance with integrity policies and procedures, including those relating to financial reporting and environmental, health and safety matters. Government and regulatory risk includes the risk that the government or regulatory actions will impose additional cost on us or require us to make adverse changes to our business models or practices.

Regulatory - We are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations and government policies that may change in significant ways.

Our businesses are subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies. There can be no assurance that laws, regulations and policies will not be changed in ways that will require us to modify our business models and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them outright. In particular, recent trends globally toward increased protectionism, import and export controls and the use of tariffs and other trade barriers can result in actions by governments around the world that have been and may continue to be disruptive and costly to our businesses, and can interfere with our global operating model and weaken our competitive position. Other legislative and regulatory areas of significance for our businesses that U.S. and non-U.S. governments have focused and continue to focus on include cybersecurity, data privacy and sovereignty, improper payments, competition law, compliance with complex economic sanctions, climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, foreign exchange intervention in response to currency volatility and currency controls that could restrict the movement of liquidity from particular jurisdictions. Potential further changes to tax laws, including additional guidance concerning the enactment of the recent U.S. tax reform, may have an effect on GE's, GE Capital's or other regulated subsidiaries' structure, operations, sales, liquidity, capital requirements, effective tax rate and performance. For example, legislative or regulatory measures by states or non-U.S. governments in response to the recent U.S. federal tax reform or otherwise, or rules, interpretations or audits under the new or existing tax laws, could increase our costs or tax rate. In addition, efforts by public and private sectors to control healthcare costs may lead to lower reimbursements and increased utilization controls related to the use of our products by healthcare providers. Regulation or government scrutiny may impact the requirements for marketing our products and slow our ability to introduce new products, resulting in an adverse impact on our business. Furthermore, we have been, and expect to continue, participating in U.S. and international governmental programs, which require us to comply with strict governmental regulations. Inability to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our status in these projects and could have collateral consequences such as debarment. Debarment, depending on the entity involved and length of time, can limit our ability to participate in other projects involving multilateral development banks and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows

Legal proceedings - We are subject to legal proceedings, investigations and legal compliance risks, including trailing liabilities from businesses that we dispose of or that are inactive.

We are subject to a variety of legal proceedings, legal compliance risks and environmental, health and safety compliance risks in virtually every part of the world. We, our representatives, and the industries in which we operate are subject to continuing scrutiny by regulators, other governmental authorities and private sector entities or individuals in the U.S., the European Union, China and other jurisdictions, which have led or may, in certain circumstances, lead to enforcement actions, adverse changes to our business practices, fines and penalties, required remedial actions such as contaminated site clean-up or the assertion of private litigation claims, and damages that could be material. For example, following our acquisition of Alstom's Thermal, Renewables and Grid businesses in 2015, we are subject to legacy legal proceedings and legal compliance risks that relate to claimed anti-competitive conduct or improper payments by Alstom in the pre-acquisition period, and payments for settlements, judgments, penalties or other liabilities in connection with those matters will result in cash outflows. In addition, since late 2017 we have been subject to a range of shareholder lawsuits and inquiries from governmental authorities related to the Company's financial performance, accounting and disclosure practices and related matters. We have observed that these proceedings related to claims about past financial performance and reporting pose particular reputational risks for the Company that can cause new allegations about past or current misconduct, even if unfounded, to have a more significant impact on our reputation and how we are viewed by investors, customers and others than they otherwise would. We have established reserves for legal matters when and as appropriate; however, the estimation of legal reserves or possible losses involves significant judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes inherent in litigation and investigations, and the actual losses arising from particular matters may exceed our current estimates and adversely affect our results of operations. While we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs, the global and diverse nature of our operations and the current enforcement environment mean that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist with respect to our operations, and we are also subject to material trailing legal liabilities from businesses that we dispose of or that are inactive. We also expect that additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time. Moreover, we sell products and services in growth markets where claims arising from alleged violations of law, product failures or other incidents involving our products and services are adjudicated within legal systems that are less developed and less reliable than those of the U.S. or other more developed markets, and this can create additional uncertainty about the outcome of proceedings before courts or other governmental bodies in such markets. See Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about legal proceedings and other loss contingencies
