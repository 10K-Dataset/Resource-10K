ITEM 1.A. RISK FACTORS

The risks and uncertainties set forth below, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this Report or in other filings by the Company with the SEC, could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to the Company or that are not currently believed by the Company to be material may also harm the Company’s business operations and financial results.

The Company faces intense competition in its markets, which could lead to reduced net sales, net earnings and cash flow.

The Company faces intense competition from consumer product companies both in the U.S. and in its international markets. Most of the Company’s products compete with other widely advertised brands within each product category. The Company also faces competition from retailers, including club stores, grocery stores, dollar stores, mass merchandisers, e-commerce retailers and subscription services, which are increasingly offering “private label” brands that are typically sold at lower prices and compete with the Company’s products in certain categories. Increased purchases of “private label” products could reduce net sales of the Company’s higher-margin products or there could be a shift in product mix to lower-margin offerings, which would negatively impact our margins.

The Company’s products generally compete on the basis of product performance, brand recognition, and price. Advertising, promotion, merchandising and packaging also have significant impacts on consumer purchasing decisions, and the Company is increasingly using digital media marketing and promotional programs to reach consumers. A newly introduced consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising, sales promotion and trade merchandising. If a product gains consumer acceptance, it typically requires continued advertising, promotional support and product improvements to maintain its relative market position. If the Company’s advertising, marketing and promotional programs, including its use of digital media to reach consumers, are not effective or adequate, the Company’s net sales may be negatively impacted.

Some of the Company’s competitors are larger than the Company and have greater financial resources. These competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities, introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than the Company can. In addition, the Company’s competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by the Company. Competitive activity may require the Company to increase its spending on advertising and promotions and/or reduce prices, which could lead to reduced net earnings and adversely affect growth.

Volatility and increases in the costs of raw materials, energy, transportation, labor and other necessary supplies or services have negatively impacted, and in the future may negatively impact, the Company’s net earnings and cash flow.

Volatility and increases in the costs of raw materials, including resin, sodium hypochlorite, linerboard, soybean oil, solvent, corrugated cardboard and other chemicals and agricultural commodities, or increases in the cost of energy, transportation, labor and other necessary supplies or services have harmed, and in the future may harm, the Company’s profits and operating results. We distribute our products and receive raw materials primarily by rail and truck. Reduced availability of rail or trucking could cause us to incur unanticipated expenses and impair our ability to distribute our products or receive our raw materials in a timely manner.

The Company believes commodity and other cost increases are possible in the future. If such increases occur or exceed the Company’s estimates and the Company is not able to increase the prices of its products or achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases, its profits and operating results will be harmed. In addition, if the Company increases the prices of its products in response to increases in the cost of commodities, and commodity costs decline, the Company may not be able to sustain its price increases. Sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or customers may decide not to pay the higher prices, which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share. While the Company seeks to project tradeoffs between price increases and volume, its projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases, which could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.

To reduce the cost volatility associated with anticipated commodity purchases, the Company uses derivative instruments, including commodity futures and swaps. The extent of the Company’s derivative position at any given time depends on the Company’s assessment of the markets for these commodities, the cost volatility in the markets and the cost of the derivative instruments. Many of the commodities used by the Company in its products do not have actively traded derivative instruments. If the Company does not or is unable to take a derivative position and costs subsequently increase, or if it executes a position and costs subsequently decrease, the Company’s costs may be greater than anticipated or higher than its competitors’ costs and the Company’s financial results could be adversely affected. For further information regarding the Company’s use of derivative instruments, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Exhibit 99.1.









Sales growth objectives may be difficult to achieve, the Company may not be able to successfully implement price increases, and market and category declines and changes to the Company’s product and geographic mix may adversely impact the Company’s financial results.

A large percentage of the Company’s revenues comes from mature markets that are subject to high levels of competition. During fiscal year2017, 83% of the Company’s net sales were generated in U.S. markets. The Company’s ability to achieve sales growth depends on its ability to drive growth through innovation, expansion into new products and categories, channels and countries, investment in its established brands and enhanced merchandising and its ability to capture market share from competitors. If the Company is unable to increase market share in existing product lines, develop product improvements, undertake sales, marketing and advertising initiatives that grow its product categories and/or develop, acquire or successfully launch new products or brands, it may not achieve its sales growth objectives. Even when the Company is successful in increasing market share within particular product categories, a decline in the markets for such product categories has had and can continue to have a negative impact on the Company’s financial results.  In addition, changes to the mix of products the Company sells, as well as the mix of countries in which its products are sold, can adversely impact the Company’s net sales, profitability and cash flow.

Dependence on key customers could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

A limited number of customers account for a large percentage of the Company’s net sales. Net sales to the Company’s largest customer, Walmart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, were

26%

,

27%

and

26%

of consolidated net sales for each of the fiscal years ended June 30,


,


and


, respectively, and occurred across all of the Company’s reportable segments. No other individual customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company's consolidated net sales in any of these fiscal years. The Company’s five largest customers accounted for nearly half of the Company's consolidated net sales for each of the fiscal years


,


and


and a significant portion of the Company's future revenues may continue to be derived from a small number of customers. As a result, changes in the strategies of the Company’s largest customers, including a reduction in the number of brands they carry, a shift of shelf space to “private label” or competitors’ products or a decision to lower pricing of consumer products, including branded products, may harm the Company’s net sales or margins, and reduce the ability of the Company to offer new innovative and improved products to consumers. In addition, the use of the latest technology by our customers regarding pricing may lead to category pricing pressures. Furthermore, any loss of a key customer or a significant reduction in net sales to a key customer, even if such loss or reduction relates to a key customer of a business unit of the Company, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, the Company’s business is based primarily upon individual sales orders, and the Company typically does not enter into long-term contracts with its customers. Accordingly, customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from the Company at any time and for any reason. If the Company does not effectively respond to the demands of its customers, they could decrease their purchases from the Company, causing the Company’s net sales and net earnings to decline. Furthermore, unfavorable market conditions or competitive pressures may cause the Company’s customers to reevaluate the number and mix of brands they sell, resulting in lower purchases of the Company’s products by these customers.

The Company continues to see retailer consolidation both in the U.S. and internationally. This trend has resulted in the increased size and influence of large consolidated retailers, who have in the past changed, and may in the future change, their business strategies, demand lower pricing or special packaging or impose other burdensome requirements on product suppliers. These business demands may relate to inventory practices, transportation and storage, a shift in focus away from branded products toward “private label” or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. These large consolidated companies could also exert additional competitive pressure on the Company’s other customers, which could in turn lead to such customers demanding lower pricing or special packaging or imposing other onerous requirements on the Company. If the Company ceases doing business with a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease due to customer inventory reductions or otherwise, the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.

The changing retail environment could affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

The Company’s sales are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery, mass retail outlet, warehouse club and dollar store channels.  However, alternative retail channels, including hard discounters, e-commerce retailers and subscription services, have become more prevalent and consumer products are increasingly being sold through such alternative retail channels.  Although the Company is engaged in e-commerce with respect to many of its products, if we are not successful in expanding sales in such alternative retail channels, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted. In addition, the growth of the alternative retail channels that are focused on limiting the number of items they sell and selling predominantly "private label" products may reduce the Company's ability to market and sell its products through such retailers. The retail environment is changing with the growth of alternative retail channels and this could significantly









change the way traditional retailers do business. If these alternative retail channels were to take significant market share away from traditional retailers and/or the Company is not successful in these alternative retail channels, our margins and results of operations may be negatively impacted.

Cyber-attacks, privacy breaches, data breaches or a failure of key information technology systems could adversely impact the Company’s ability to conduct business.

The Company relies extensively on information technology systems, many of which are managed by third-party service providers, in order to conduct its business. These systems include, but are not limited to, programs and processes relating to communicating within the Company and with customers, consumers, vendors, investors and other parties, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with financial reporting, regulatory, legal and tax requirements and implementing other processes involved in managing the business. Although the Company has made progress with its implementation of enterprise-wide upgrades to its hardware, software and operating systems, legacy systems still remain. If the Company’s existing and/or future technology systems, third-party service providers and processes do not adequately support the future growth of the Company’s business, the Company’s business may be adversely impacted.  In addition, the Company from time to time may need to upgrade its information technology systems.  If a new system does not function properly, it could affect the Company's ability to process and deliver customer orders and process and receive payments for its products.  This could adversely impact the Company's results of operations and cash flows.

digestive health products and other products directly to consumers online and through websites, mobile apps and connected devices, and the Company offers promotions, rebates, customer loyalty and other programs through which it may receive personal information, and it or its vendors could experience cyber-attacks, privacy breaches, data breaches or other incidents that may result in unauthorized disclosure of consumer, customer, employee, vendor or Company information.

If the Company suffers a loss as a result of a breach or other breakdown in its technology, including cyber-attack, privacy breaches, data breaches or other incident involving the Company or any of the Company’s vendors, that result in unauthorized disclosure or significant unavailability of business, financial, personal or stakeholder information, the Company's reputation, competitiveness and/or business may be harmed and the Company may be exposed to legal liability, which may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and/or financial condition. In addition, if the Company’s service providers, suppliers or customers experience a breach or unauthorized disclosure or system failure, their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected, which may result in a disruption in the Company’s supply chain or reduced customer orders or other business operations, which would adversely affect the Company.

Government regulations could impose material costs.

Generally, the manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution and advertising of the Company’s products and the conduct of its business operations must all comply with extensive federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. For example, in the U.S., many of the Company’s products are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration and the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and the Company’s product claims and advertising are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission, among other regulatory agencies. Most states have agencies that regulate in parallel to these federal agencies. The Company’s international operations are also subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which it manufactures or distributes its products. There is also a risk of potentially higher incidence of fraud or corruption in certain foreign jurisdictions and related difficulties in maintaining effective internal controls. Additionally, the Company could be subject to inquiries or investigations by governmental and other regulatory bodies. Any determination that the Company’s operations or activities are not in compliance with applicable law could expose the Company to future









impairment charges or significant fines, penalties or other sanctions that may result in a reduction in net income or otherwise adversely impact the business and reputation of the Company.

In particular, because of the Company’s extensive international operations, we could be adversely affected by violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, joint-venture partners or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Additionally, recent reform proposals have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies, tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries. Major developments in tax policy or trade relations could have a material effect on our balance sheet and results of operations.

If the Company is found to be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas, including the evolving regulations related to privacy and data security and protection, it could be subject to civil remedies, including fines, import detentions, injunctions, product withdrawals or recalls or asset seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business. Loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations, particularly with respect to its charcoal business, could delay or prevent the Company from meeting current product demand, introducing new products, building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results. As the Company expands its natural personal care and healthcare businesses such as through Burt’s Bees

®

, HealthLink

®

, Aplicare

®

and Caltech Industries, an increasing number of its products have and will become subject to regulations and laws relating to drugs and medical devices. In addition, the Company's digestive health space business resulting from its acquisition of RenewLife

®

has products that are subject to regulations relating to dietary supplements. In order to comply with these laws and regulations, the Company may be required to make changes to product formulation, labeling or marketing claims, perform additional testing to substantiate its product claims, make costly changes in its manufacturing processes or supply chain or stop selling certain products until corrective actions have been taken.

Acquisitions, new venture investments and divestitures may not be successful, which could impact the Company’s business operations and financial results.

In connection with the Company’s strategy, the Company expects to continue to seek acquisition opportunities, such as the fiscal year 2016 acquisition of RenewLife, which competes in the digestive health category. However, the Company may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable strategic acquisitions at attractive prices. In addition, all acquisitions and investments entail numerous risks, including risks relating to the Company’s ability to:

•successfully integrate acquired companies, products, systems or personnel into the Company’s existing business operations;

•maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies throughout acquired companies, including effective integration of acquired companies into the Company's internal controls over financial reporting;

•minimize any potential interruption to the ongoing business of the Company or the acquired company;

•successfully enter categories and markets in which the Company may have limited or no prior experience;

•achieve expected synergies and obtain the desired financial or strategic benefits from acquisitions;

•achieve distribution expansion related to products, categories and markets from acquisitions; and

•retain key relationships with employees, customers, partners and suppliers of acquired companies.









Acquired companies or operations or joint ventures may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability and cash flow expectations. Future acquisitions or ventures could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, the assumption of contingent liabilities, including litigation, an increase in expenses related to certain assets and increased operating expenses, all of which could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. Future acquisitions of foreign companies or new foreign ventures would subject the Company to local regulations and could potentially lead to risks related to, among other things, increased exposure to foreign exchange rate changes, tax or labor laws, government price control, repatriation of profits and liabilities relating to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In addition, to the extent that the economic benefits associated with any of the Company’s acquisitions diminish in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill, intangible assets or other assets associated with such acquisitions, which could adversely affect its operating results and/or net earnings per share.

The Company may also divest certain assets, businesses or brands that do not meet the Company’s strategic objectives or growth targets. With respect to any divestiture, the Company may encounter difficulty finding potential acquirers or other divestiture options on favorable terms. Any divestiture could affect the profitability of the Company as a result of the gains or losses on such sale of a business or brand, the loss of the operating income or sales resulting from such sale or the costs or liabilities that are not assumed by the acquirer that may negatively impact profitability and cash flow subsequent to any divestiture. The Company may also be required to recognize impairment charges as a result of a divestiture.

In addition, any potential future acquisitions, new ventures or divestitures may divert the attention of management and resources from matters that are core or critical to the Company’s business.

Uncertain worldwide, regional and local economic and financial market conditions may negatively impact the Company and consumers of its products, which would negatively affect the Company’s financial performance and liquidity.

Although the Company continues to devote significant resources to support its brands, uncertain economic conditions have negatively affected, and may continue to negatively affect, consumer demand for the Company’s products. Consumers may also be sensitive to economic uncertainty or unfavorable economic conditions and reduce discretionary spending, which may lead to reduced net sales or cause a shift in the Company’s product mix from higher-margin to lower-margin products. Consumers may increase purchases of lower-priced or “private label” products, and the Company’s competitors may increase levels of advertising and promotional activity for lower-priced products as they seek to maintain sales volumes during uncertain economic times, which may negatively impact the Company’s net sales.

Global markets continued to face threats and uncertainty during fiscal year2017. Uncertain economic and financial market conditions may also adversely affect the financial condition of the Company’s customers, suppliers and other business partners. If customers’ financial conditions are adversely affected, customers may reduce their purchases of the Company’s products or the Company may not be able to collect accounts receivable, each of which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business operations or financial results.

The Company is subject to risks related to its international operations and international trade.

In fiscal year2017, 17% of the Company’s net sales were generated in international markets.  The Company faces and will continue to face substantial risks associated with its foreign operations, including the following:

•economic or political instability;

•price controls and related government actions;

•foreign currency fluctuations, currency controls and inflation, which may adversely affect the Company’s ability to do business in certain markets and reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenues, profits or cash flows it generates in non-U.S. markets;

•continued high levels of inflation in Argentina, which may result in the Company adopting hyperinflationary accounting treatment for Argentina's operations;

•difficulty in obtaining non-local currency (e.g., U.S. dollars) to pay for the raw materials needed to manufacture the Company’s products and contract-manufactured products;

•restrictions on or costs related to the repatriation of foreign profits to the U.S., including possible taxes or withholding obligations on any repatriations;

•the imposition of tariffs, trade restrictions, price, profit or other government controls, labor laws, travel or immigration restrictions, import and export laws or other government actions generating a negative impact on the Company’s business, including changes in trade policies that may be implemented and the impact of geopolitical events generally;

•difficulties in hiring and retaining qualified employees;

•civil unrest, work stoppages and labor disputes;









•employment litigation related to employees, contractors and suppliers, particularly in Argentina;

•difficulties in obtaining or unavailability of raw materials;

•potential loss of distribution channels as a result of retailer consolidation;

•increased credit risk of customers, suppliers and distributors;

•potential harm to third parties, the Company’s employees and/or surrounding communities, and related liabilities and damages to the Company’s reputation, from the use, storage and transportation of chlorine in certain international markets where chlorine is used in the production of bleach, whether such actions are undertaken by the Company or by the Company’s business partners;

•difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights;

•lack of well-established or reliable, and impartial legal systems in certain countries where the Company operates;

•challenges relating to enforcement of or compliance with local laws and regulations and with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the U.S., including without limitation, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;

•the possibility of nationalization, expropriation of assets or other similar government actions; and

•risks related to the Company’s discontinued operations in Venezuela.



In addition, changes as result of the United Kingdom's decision to exit the European Union could subject the Company to heightened risks in that region, including disruptions to trade and free movement of goods, services and people to and from the United Kingdom, increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the British pound and additional legal and economic uncertainty. Moreover, as a result of the 2016 U.S. presidential and Congressional elections, there may be shifts in U.S. foreign trade, economic and other policies that may negatively impact our foreign operations and our ability to market our products in certain international markets.  All of the foregoing risks could have a significant adverse impact on the Company’s ability to commercialize its products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition. The Company’s small sales volume in some countries, relative to some multinational and local competitors, could exacerbate such risks.

In addition, the Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks with respect to its net sales, net earnings and cash flow driven by movements of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies. A weakening of the currencies in which sales are generated relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated would decrease net earnings and cash flow. Although the Company uses instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks, these hedges only offset a small portion of the Company’s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and, therefore, the Company’s reported net earnings may be negatively affected by changes in foreign exchange rates.

Inflation is another risk associated with the Company’s international operations. For example, Argentina could in the future be designated as a highly inflationary economy. Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of non-U.S. dollar monetary assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in net earnings. Other countries in which the Company operates may also become highly inflationary or such countries’ currencies may be devalued, or both, which may negatively impact the Company’s business operations and financial results.

For further information regarding Argentina, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Exhibit 99.1.

The Company may not successfully achieve its innovation goals, or develop and introduce new products and line extensions or expand into adjacent categories and countries, which could adversely impact its financial results.









or new or expanded adjacencies are not successful, costs associated with these efforts may not be fully recouped and the Company’s net earnings could be adversely affected. In addition, if sales generated by new products cause a decline in sales of the Company’s existing products, the Company’s financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

Profitability and cash flow could suffer if the Company is unable to generate anticipated cost savings, successfully implement its strategies, or efficiently manage supply chain and manufacturing processes.

Harm to the Company’s reputation or the reputation of one or more of its leading brands could have an adverse effect on the business.

An increase in the value of the Company’s Glad®business would result in an increase in the Company’s purchase obligation for The Procter & Gamble Company’s, P&G’s, 20% interest in that business, which may adversely affect the Company’s net earnings and cash flow. Additionally, it is uncertain whether the Company’s net earnings and cash flow would be adversely affected more by an extension or a termination of the agreement related to the Glad®business.

In January 2003, the Company entered into a venture agreement with P&G related to the Company’s Glad®bags, wraps and containers business. In connection with this agreement, P&G provides research and development support to the Glad®business. The agreement with P&G will expire in January 2023 unless the parties agree, on or prior to January 2018, to extend the term of the agreement for another 10 years or agree to take some other relevant action.

Unless extended, the agreement will require the Company to purchase P&G’s 20% interest in January 2023 for cash at fair value as established by predetermined valuation procedures. As ofJune 30, 2017, the estimated fair value of P&G’s interest was$458 million, of which $317 millionhas been recognized by the Company and is reflected in Other liabilities in the Company’sJune 30, 2017Consolidated Balance Sheet. The difference between the estimated fair value and the amount recognized, and any future changes in the fair value of P&G’s interest, is charged to Cost of products sold in accordance with the effective interest method over the remaining life of the agreement. The estimated fair value of P&G's interest increased significantly over the past several years and may continue to change up until any such purchase by the Company of P&G’s









interest. Any additional significant increases in the fair value of such interest may adversely affect the Company’s net earnings and future cash flow.

If the Company and P&G decide not to extend the term of the agreement, this decision may harm the terms on which the Company has access to innovation from P&G. Alternatively, if the Company and P&G decide to extend the term of the agreement, there can be no assurance that any future innovation will result. In either case, net earnings and cash flow may be negatively impacted. For additional information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Exhibit 99.1.

Reliance on a limited base of suppliers may result in disruptions to the Company’s business.

The Company relies on a limited number of suppliers for certain commodities and raw material inputs, including sole-source and single-source suppliers for certain of its raw materials, packaging, product components, finished products and other necessary supplies. New suppliers have to be qualified under Company standards and may also have to be qualified under governmental and industry standards, and any relevant standards of the Company's customers, which can require additional investment and time. The Company could experience disruptions in production and its financial results and relationships with customers could be adversely affected if the Company is unable to qualify any needed new suppliers or maintain supplier arrangements and relationships, if it is unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity, quality and price levels needed for its business or if any of the Company’s key suppliers becomes insolvent or  experiences financial distress or if any environmental, economic or other outside factors impact its operations.

Product liability, commercial claims or other legal proceedings could adversely affect the Company’s net sales and operating results, including cash flow.

The Company has in the past paid, and may be required in the future to pay, for losses or injuries purportedly caused by its products. Such claims may be based on allegations that, among other things, the Company’s products contain contaminants or provide inadequate instructions or warnings regarding their use, have defective packaging, fail to perform as advertised, or damage property or persons. Product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm the Company’s reputation, sales and operating results and the reputation of the Company's brands. In addition, if any of the Company’s products is found to be defective, the Company may recall it, which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses. Although the Company maintains product liability insurance coverage, insurance recovery for product liability claims may be subject to a retention, exceed the amount of insurance coverage or be excluded under the terms of the policies.

In addition, the Company is, and may in the future become, the subject of, or party to, various pending or threatened legal actions, government investigations and proceedings from time to time, including advertising disputes with competitors, consumer class actions, including those related to advertising claims, labor claims, breach of contract claims, antitrust litigation, securities litigation, premises liability claims and litigation in foreign jurisdictions. In general, claims made by or against the Company in litigation, investigations, disputes or other proceedings have been and can in the future be expensive and time-consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements, injunctions or damages that could significantly affect its business or financial results or condition. It is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation, investigations, disputes or proceedings with which the Company currently is or may in the future become involved. The impact of these matters on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be material. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Exhibit 99.1 for additional information related to these matters.

Loss of, or inability to attract, key personnel could adversely impact the Company’s business.

The Company’s success depends, in part, on its ability to retain its key personnel, including its executive officers and senior management team. The unexpected loss of one or more of the Company’s key employees could disrupt its business. The Company’s success also depends, in part, on its continuing ability to identify, hire, train and retain other highly qualified personnel. Competition for these employees can be intense, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the Company’s headquarters and largest research facility are located. In addition, the Company's employees may be targeted and recruited by other companies. As the Company expands into new categories or markets, including more regulated businesses, it will also require personnel with relevant training and experience in such categories or markets. The Company may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future, and its failure to do so could adversely affect the Company.

Environmental matters create potential liabilities that could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

The Company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including those relating to air emissions, water discharges, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances and climate change. The Company has incurred,









and will continue to incur, significant expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations and in providing physical security for its worldwide operations, and such expenditures reduce the cash flow available to the Company for other purposes.

The Company is currently involved in or has potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of its current and former facilities. In addition, some of its present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many years and, over that time, some of those facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous. It is possible that those sites, as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to whom the Company has sent waste, may be identified and become the subject of remediation. The Company could also become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition.

The Company had a recorded liability of $28 million and $14 million as of June 30,2017and2016, respectively, for its share of aggregate future remediation costs related to certain environmental matters, including response actions at various locations. One matter, which accounted for $14 million and less than $1 million of the recorded liability as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, relates to environmental costs associated with one of the Company’s former operations at a site located in Alameda County, California. Another matter, in Dickinson County, Michigan, for which the Company is jointly and severally liable, accounted for $12 million and $11 million of the recorded liability as of June 30,2017and2016, respectively.  The Company’s estimated losses related to these matters are sensitive to a variety of uncertain factors, including the efficacy of any remediation efforts, changes in any remediation requirements, and the future availability of alternative clean-up technologies, and the Company’s exposure may exceed the amount recorded for these matters.  See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Exhibit 99.1 for additional information related to these liabilities.

The Company also handles and/or transports hazardous substances, including but not limited to chlorine, at some of its international production facilities. A release of such chemicals, whether in transit or at the Company’s facilities, due to accident or an intentional act, could result in substantial liability and business disruptions.

The facilities of the Company and its suppliers are subject to disruption by events beyond the Company’s control.

Operations at facilities of the Company, its suppliers, service providers and retail customers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including work stoppages, demonstrations, disease outbreaks or pandemics, acts of war, terrorism, fire, earthquakes, flooding or other natural disasters. The Company’s corporate headquarters and primary research and development facility are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. If a major disruption were to occur, it could result in injury to people, damages to the natural environment, temporary loss of access to critical data, delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations. Any such disruption could have a material adverse impact on the Company and its financial results.

Failure to maximize, successfully assert or successfully defend the Company’s intellectual property rights could impact its competitiveness.

If the Company is found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others or cannot obtain necessary intellectual property rights from others, its competitiveness could be negatively impacted.

If the Company is found to have violated the trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly, through the use of third-party marks, ideas or technologies, such a finding could result in the need to cease use of such trademark, trade secret, copyrighted work or patented invention in the Company’s business and the obligation to pay for past infringement. If holders are willing to permit the Company to continue to use such intellectual









property rights, they could require a payment of a substantial amount for continued use of those rights. Either ceasing use or paying such amounts could cause the Company to become less competitive and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, operating results and financial condition.

Even if the Company is not found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights, claims of infringement could adversely affect the Company’s business. For example, if the Company seeks proposals from multiple vendors for a new product or innovation and chooses to partner with a particular vendor, another vendor may claim the Company infringed its intellectual property rights by using information gathered from the vendor proposals. The Company could incur material legal costs and related expenses to defend against such claims and the Company could incur significant costs associated with discontinuing to use, provide or manufacture certain products, services or trademarks even if it is ultimately found not to have infringed such rights.

The Company’s indebtedness could adversely affect its business operations and financial results and prevent the Company from fulfilling its obligations, and the Company may incur substantially more debt in the future, which could exacerbate these risks.

As ofJune 30, 2017, the Company had over $2 billion of debt. The Company’s indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:

•require the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, future acquisitions, dividends and for other general corporate purposes;

•limit the Company’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to general adverse economic conditions or changes in its business and the industries in which it operates;

•place the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt; and

•limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the Company’s debt documents, its ability to borrow additional funds.

Additionally, failure by the Company to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in its debt documents could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could have a significant adverse effect on the Company. Further, certain terms of the agreements governing the Company’s over-the-counter derivative instruments contain provisions that require the Company’s credit ratings, as assigned by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s to the Company, to remain at a level equal to or better than the minimum of an investment grade credit rating. As ofJune 30, 2017, the Company had been assigned investment-grade ratings with both Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. However, if the Company’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade, the counterparties to the derivative instruments in net liability positions could request full collateralization.

The Company may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions, repurchase shares or fund other activities for general business purposes, subject to compliance with the Company’s existing debt covenants. As ofJune 30, 2017, the Company could add approximately $4 billion in incremental debt and remain in compliance with its debt covenants, although the actual amount that the Company may be able to borrow in the future may not equal this amount. If new debt is added to the current debt levels, the related risks that the Company now faces could intensify. In addition, the cost of incurring additional debt could increase due to rising interest rates, possible downgrades in the Company’s credit rating, economic conditions or otherwise. In this regard, failure to maintain the Company's credit ratings could adversely affect the interest rate in future financings, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets.

The Company may not continue to pay dividends or repurchase its stock.

Although the Company has historically declared and paid quarterly cash dividends on its common stock and has been authorized to repurchase its shares subject to certain limitations under its share repurchase programs, any determinations by the board of directors to continue to declare and pay cash dividends on the Company’s common stock or to repurchase the Company’s common stock will be based primarily upon the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and business requirements, the price of its common stock in the case of the repurchase program and the board of directors’ continuing determination that the repurchase programs and the declaration and payment of dividends are in the best interests of the Company’s stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs. The Company’s ability to continue to declare and pay cash dividends will depend upon, among other things, its cash balances and future cash requirements, results of operations, financial condition and net earnings, all of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond the Company’s control. In the event









the Company does not declare and pay a quarterly dividend or discontinues its share repurchases, the Company’s stock price could be adversely affected.

The Company’s continued growth and expansion and reliance on third-party service providers could adversely affect its internal control over financial reporting, which could harm its business and financial results.

Clorox management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of the Company’s financial statements would be prevented or detected. The Company’s continuing growth and expansion in domestic and globally dispersed markets, such as its acquisition of RenewLife, may place significant additional pressure on the Company’s system of internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, the Company engages the services of third parties to assist with business operations and financial reporting processes, which injects additional monitoring obligations and risk into the system of internal control. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit the Company’s ability to report its financial results accurately and on a timely basis, or to detect and prevent fraud and could expose it to regulatory enforcement action and shareholder claims.

The Company’s judgments regarding the accounting for tax positions and the resolution of tax disputes may impact the Company’s net earnings and cash flow.

Significant judgment is required to determine the Company’s effective tax rate and evaluate its tax positions. The Company provides for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement criteria prescribed by applicable accounting standards. Fluctuations in federal, state, local and foreign taxes or a change to uncertain tax positions, including related interest and penalties, may impact the Company’s effective tax rate and the Company’s financial results. When particular tax matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved. Unfavorable resolution of any tax matter in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the effective tax rate, which would have an adverse effect on the Company’s operating results. Any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution. For additional information, see the information set forth in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Exhibit 99.1.

The estimates and assumptions on which the Company’s financial projections are based may prove to be inaccurate, which may cause its actual results to materially differ from such projections, which may adversely affect the Company’s future profitability, cash flows and stock price.

The Company’s financial projections are dependent on certain estimates and assumptions related to, among other things, category growth, development and launch of innovative new products, market share projections, product pricing, volume and product mix, foreign exchange rates and volatility, commodity prices, distribution, cost savings, accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves, goodwill, measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans and the Company’s ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in its existing business, fund internal growth, repurchase its shares, make acquisitions, pay dividends and meet debt obligations. While the Company’s financial projections are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made, the Company’s actual results may differ materially from its financial projections. Any material variation between the Company’s financial projections and its actual results may adversely affect the Company’s future profitability, cash flows and stock price.

The Company is subject to risks related to its discontinued operations in Venezuela.
