RISK FACTORS

We are subject to various risks and events that could adversely affect our business, our financial condition, our results of operations, our cash flows and the price of our common stock.

You should consider the following risk factors, in addition to the information presented elsewhere in this report, particularly in “

Forward-Looking Statements

” and "

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

" as well as in the filings we make from time to time with the SEC, in evaluating us, our business and an investment in our securities.

The risks discussed below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely affect our business.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRIES AND BUSINESS

MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS

The industries in which we operate are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions and consequently are highly cyclical.

The overall levels of demand for the products we manufacture and distribute reflect fluctuations in levels of end-user demand, which consequently impact our sales and profitability. End-user demand depends in part on general macroeconomic conditions, both in the U.S. and globally, as well as on local economic conditions. Current economic conditions in the United States reflect growth at or below historical trends and general business uncertainty. Global economic conditions reflect issues such as inflation and slowing growth in emerging countries. The construction and homebuilding industries continue to slowly recover from the severe downturn caused by the overall collapse of credit markets and recession of 2009. However, construction activity remains below pre-recession and trend levels. Our Wood Products segment is highly dependent on the strength of the homebuilding industry. The decline in home construction activity due to the recession resulted in depressed prices of and reduced demand for wood products and building materials. This resulted in lower prices and demand for logs and reduced harvests in our Timberlands segment. The length and magnitude of industry cycles vary over time and by product, but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions and levels of industry capacity. Those conditions have improved since the recession, but if macroeconomic conditions do not continue to improve we could experience lower sales volumes and smaller margins.

COMMODITY PRODUCTS

Many of our products are commodities that are widely available from other producers.

Because commodity products have few distinguishing properties from producer to producer, competition for these products is based primarily on price, which is determined by supply relative to demand and competition from substitute products. In addition, prices for our products are affected by many other factors outside of our control. As a result, we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes, which often are volatile. Our profitability with respect to these products depends, in part, on managing our costs, particularly raw material and energy costs, which represent significant components of our operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control. Both sales and profitability of our products are subject to volatility due to market forces beyond our control.

INDUSTRY SUPPLY OF LOGS, WOOD PRODUCTS AND PULP

Excess supply of products may adversely affect prices and margins.

Oversupply of products may result from producers introducing new capacity for manufactured products or increasing harvest levels in response to favorable short-term pricing trends. Industry supplies of pulp are also influenced by global production capacity, which has grown in recent years and is expected to continue to grow. Continuation of these factors could adversely affect our sales volumes and margins.

HOMEBUILDING MARKET AND ECONOMIC RISKS

High unemployment, low demand and low levels of consumer confidence can adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Our business is dependent upon the health of the U.S. housing market. Demand for homes is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as the level of employment, consumer confidence, consumer income, the availability of financing and interest rate levels. The legacy of the housing bubble, its collapse and ensuing credit crisis was tightened credit requirements and a reduced number of mortgage loans available for financing home purchases. Although credit conditions have eased, they remain more restrictive than prior to the housing bubble. Demand for new homes also has been adversely affected by factors such as unemployment and lower job participation, limited wage growth and weak consumer confidence. Additionally, rising student loan debt among younger adults is limiting access to mortgage financing and home ownership. Foreclosure rates and distress sales of houses, have fallen significantly and are less of an impact compared to the years immediately following the housing collapse.

Homebuyers’ ability to qualify for and obtain affordable mortgages could be affected by changes in government sponsored entities and private mortgage insurance companies supporting the mortgage market.

The federal government has historically had a significant role in supporting mortgage lending through its sponsorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. As a result of turbulence in credit markets and the mortgage finance industry in the last few years, the effect of the federal government

’

s conservatorship of these government sponsored entities on the short-term and long-term demand for new housing remains unclear.

The liquidity provided to the mortgage industry by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both of which purchase home mortgages and mortgage-backed securities originated by mortgage lenders, is critical to the housing market. There have been significant concerns about the future purpose of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and a number of proposals to curtail their activities over time are under review. Limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these entities could adversely affect interest rates and the availability of mortgage financing, which could reduce demand for housing and adversely affect demand for our products.

2015 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



Changes in mortgage interest expense and real estate tax regulations could harm our future sales and earnings.

Significant costs of homeownership include mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes, both of which are generally deductible for an individual

’

s federal and, in some cases, state income taxes. Any changes to income tax laws by the federal government or a state government to eliminate or substantially reduce these income tax deductions, as has been considered from time to time, would increase the after-tax cost of owning a home. Increases in real estate taxes by local governmental authorities would also increase the cost of homeownership. Any such increases to the cost of homeownership could adversely affect the demand for our products.

CAPITAL MARKETS

Deterioration in economic conditions and the credit markets could adversely affect our access to capital.

Upset financial or credit market conditions can impair the company

’

s ability to borrow money or otherwise access credit markets on terms acceptable to us, which may, among other impacts, reduce our ability to take advantage of growth and expansion opportunities. Similarly, our customers may be unable to borrow money to fund their operations. Similarly, deteriorating or volatile market conditions could have an adverse effect on our customers and suppliers and their ability to purchase our products or sell products to us.

CHANGES IN CREDIT RATINGS

Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.

Credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results, actions that we take, their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy. Actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining, upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing the company on a watch list for possible future downgrading. Downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading could limit our access to the credit markets, increase our cost of financing, and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.

SUBSTITUTION

Some of our products are vulnerable to declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials.

Our products may compete with nonfiber-based alternatives or with alternative products in certain market segments. For example, plastic, wood/plastic or composite materials may be used by builders as alternatives to the products produced by our Wood Products businesses such as lumber, veneer, plywood and oriented strand board. Changes in prices for oil, chemicals and wood-based fiber can change the competitive position of our products relative to available alternatives and could increase substitution of those products for our products. If use of these alternative products grows, demand for and pricing of our products could be adversely affected.

CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX OR PRICING

Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by changes in product mix or pricing.

Our results may be adversely affected by a change in our product mix or pricing. If we are not successful in implementing previously announced or future price increases, or in our plans to increase sales of higher-priced, higher-value products, or if there are delays in acceptance of price increases or failure of customers to accept higher-priced products our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Price discounting, if required to maintain our competitive position, could result in lower than anticipated price realizations.

INTENSE COMPETITION

We face intense competition in our markets, and the failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We compete with North American and, for many of our product lines, global producers, some of which may have greater financial resources and lower production costs than we do. The principal basis for competition for many of our products is selling price. Our ability to maintain satisfactory margins depends in large part on our ability to control our costs. Our industries also are particularly sensitive to other factors including innovation, design, quality and service, with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line. To the extent that one or more of our competitors become more successful with respect to any key competitive factor, our ability to attract and retain customers could be materially adversely affected. If we are unable to compete effectively, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Expiration of the Softwood Lumber Agreement creates uncertainty about competition from Canadian imports

.

Historically, Canada has been a significant source of lumber for the U.S. market, particularly in the new home construction market. We produce lumber in our Canadian mills, but the bulk of our production is in the U.S.  The Softwood Lumber Agreement (SLA) between Canada and the U.S., originally signed in October 2006, expired in October 2015. The 2006 SLA required Canadian softwood lumber facilities, including our mills, to pay an export tax when the price of lumber is at or below a threshold price. We are not able to predict when or if a new agreement will be reached or, if reached, what the terms of the agreement would be. We could experience downward pressure on timber and lumber prices caused by Canadian lumber imports.

Another emerging form of competition is between brands of sustainably produced products; customer demand for certain brands could reduce competition among buyers for our products or cause other adverse effects.

In North America, our forests are third party-certified to the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI

®

) standard. Some of our customers have expressed a preference in certain of our product lines for products made from raw materials sourced from forests certified to different standards, including standards of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). If and to the extent that preference for a standard other than SFI

®

becomes a customer requirement, there may be reduced demand and lower prices for our products relative to competitors who can supply products sourced from forests certified to competing certification standards. If we seek to comply with such other standards, we could incur materially increased costs for our operations or be required to modify our operations, such as reducing harvest levels. FSC, in particular, employs standards that are geographically variable and could cause a material reduction in the harvest levels of some of our timberlands, most notably in the Pacific Northwest.

2015 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



MATERIAL DISRUPTION OF MANUFACTURING

A material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales or negatively affect our results of operation and financial condition.

Any of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including:

•

unscheduled maintenance outages,

•

prolonged power failures,

•

equipment failure,

•

a chemical spill or release,

•

explosion of a boiler,

•

fires, floods, windstorms, earthquakes, hurricanes or other severe weather conditions or catastrophes,

affecting the production of goods or the supply of raw materials (including fiber),

•

the effect of drought or reduced rainfall on water supply,

•

labor difficulties,

•

disruptions in transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, rail, tunnels, shipping and port facilities,

•

terrorism or threats of terrorism,

•

governmental regulations, and

•

other operational problems.

Any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products or require us to make unplanned capital expenditures. If one of our facilities or machines were to incur significant downtime, our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired, resulting in lower sales and income. Although some risks are not insurable and some coverage is limited, we purchase insurance protecting our manufacturing facilities from fires, floods, windstorms, earthquakes, equipment failures and boiler explosions.

STRATEGIC INITIATIVES

Our business and financial results may be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully execute on important strategic initiatives.

There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations, which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results. These strategic initiatives are designed to improve our results of operations and drive long-term shareholder value, and include, among others: maximizing cash flow through operational excellence; reducing costs to achieve industry-leading cost structure; and innovating in higher-margin products

.

We may be unsuccessful in carrying out our acquisition strategy.

We intend to strategically pursue acquisitions of timberland properties when market conditions warrant. As with any investment, our acquisitions may not perform in accordance with our expectations. In addition, we anticipate financing such acquisitions through cash from operations, borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities, proceeds from equity or debt offerings or proceeds from asset dispositions, or any combination thereof. Our inability to finance future acquisitions on favorable terms could adversely affect our results of operations.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

Our operations require substantial capital.

Our businesses require substantial capital for expansion and for repair or replacement of existing facilities or equipment. Although we maintain our production equipment with regular scheduled maintenance, key pieces of equipment may need to be repaired or replaced periodically. The costs of repairing or replacing such equipment and the associated downtime of the affected production line could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

While we believe our capital resources will be adequate to meet our current projected operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements, if for any reason we are unable to provide for our operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements on acceptable economic terms, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS

We could incur substantial costs as a result of compliance with, violations of, or liabilities under applicable environmental laws and other laws and regulations.

We are subject to a wide range of general and industry-specific laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing:

•

air emissions,

•

wastewater discharges,

•

harvesting and other silvicultural activities,

•

forestry operations and endangered species habitat protection,

•

surface water management,

•

the storage, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes,

•

the cleanup of contaminated sites,

•

landfill operation and closure obligations,

•

building codes, and

•

health and safety matters.

We have incurred, and we expect to continue to incur, significant capital, operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations and as a result of remedial obligations. We also could incur substantial costs, such as civil or criminal fines,

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >

2015 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



sanctions and enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment or other remedial actions), cleanup and closure costs, and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations.

As the owner and operator of real estate, we may be liable under environmental laws for cleanup, closure and other damages resulting from the presence and release of hazardous substances on or from our properties or operations. In addition, surface water management regulations may present liabilities and are subject to change. The amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict, and in some cases, our liability may exceed forecasted amounts or the value of the property itself. The discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at our sites or third-party sites may result in significant additional costs. Any material liability we incur could adversely affect our financial condition or preclude us from making capital expenditures that otherwise would benefit our business.

We also anticipate public policy developments at the state, federal and international level regarding climate change and energy access, security and competitiveness. We expect these developments to address emission of carbon dioxide, renewable energy and fuel standards, and the monetization of carbon. Compliance with regulations that implement new public policy in these areas might require significant expenditures. These developments may also include mandated changes to energy use and building codes which could affect our homebuilding practices. Enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the interpretation of these laws or regulations, might require significant expenditures. We also anticipate public policy developments at the state, federal and international level regarding taxes and a number of other areas that could require significant expenditures.

Changes in global or regional climate conditions and governmental response to such changes at the international, U.S. federal and state levels may affect our operations or our planned or future growth activities.

There continue to be numerous international, U.S. federal and state-level initiatives and proposals to address domestic and global climate issues. Within the U.S. and Canada, some of these proposals would (and have in some Canadian provinces) regulate and/or tax the production of carbon dioxide and other “greenhouse gases” to facilitate the reduction of carbon compound emissions into the atmosphere and provide tax and other incentives to produce and use “cleaner” energy. Climate change impacts, if they occur, and governmental initiatives, laws and regulations to address potential climate concerns, could increase our costs and have a long-term adverse impact on our businesses and results of operations. Future legislation or regulatory activity in this area remains uncertain, and its impact on our operations is unclear at this time. However, it is possible that legislation or government mandates, standards or regulations intended to mitigate or reduce carbon compound or greenhouse gas emissions or other climate change impacts could adversely affect our operations. For example, such activities could limit harvest levels or result in significantly higher costs for energy and other raw materials. Because our manufacturing operations depend upon significant amounts of energy and raw materials, these initiatives could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and profitability.

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES

We will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates.

We have manufacturing operations in Canada, Poland and Uruguay. We are also a large exporter and compete with global producers of products very similar to ours. Therefore, we are affected by changes in the strength of the U.S. dollar, particularly relative to the Canadian dollar, euro and yen, and the strength of the euro relative to the yen. Changes in exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our sales volumes, margins and results of operations.

AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS AND ENERGY

Our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials and energy.

We rely heavily on certain raw materials (principally wood fiber and chemicals) and energy sources (principally natural gas, electricity, coal and fuel oil) in our manufacturing processes. Our ability to increase earnings has been, and will continue to be, affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials and energy sources. We may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material or energy costs through hedging arrangements, price increases, productivity improvements or cost-reduction programs.

PEOPLE

Our business is dependent upon attracting, retaining and developing key personnel.

We believe that our success depends, to a significant extent, upon our ability to attract, retain and develop key senior management and operations management personnel. Our failure to recruit, retain, and develop key personnel could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.

TRANSPORTATION

We depend on third parties for transportation services and increases in costs and disruptions in the availability of transportation could materially adversely affect our business and operations.

Our business depends on the transportation of a large number of products, both domestically and internationally. We rely primarily on third parties for transportation of the products we manufacture or distribute as well as delivery of our raw materials. A significant portion of the goods we manufacture and raw materials we use are transported by marine, rail and truck, each of which is highly regulated. In addition, each has historically been subject to periodic disruption due to labor issues.

If any of our third-party transportation providers were to fail to deliver the goods we manufacture or distribute in a timely manner, we may be unable to sell those products at full value, or at all. Similarly, if any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner, we may be unable to manufacture our products in response to customer demand. In addition, if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us, we may be unable to replace them at reasonable cost. Our third-party transportation providers are also subject to events outside of their control, such as disruption of transportation infrastructure due to labor issues or natural disasters.

Any failure of a third-party transportation provider to deliver raw materials or finished products in a timely manner could harm our reputation, negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.

In addition, an increase in transportation rates or fuel surcharges could materially adversely affect our sales and profitability.

REIT STATUS AND TAX IMPLICATIONS

If we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, our taxable income would be subject to tax at corporate rates and we would not be able to deduct dividends to shareholders.

In any taxable year in which we fail to qualify as a REIT, unless we are entitled to relief under the Internal Revenue Code:

•

We would not be allowed to deduct dividends to shareholders in computing our taxable income.

•

We would be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at applicable corporate rates.

•

We also would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost qualification.

Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our operations and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. There are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions. Although we operate in a manner consistent with the REIT qualification rules, we cannot assure you that we are or will remain so qualified.

Certain of our business activities are subject to corporate-level income tax and potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax.

Under the Internal Revenue Code, REITs generally must engage in the ownership and management of income producing real estate. For the Company, this generally includes owning and managing a timberland portfolio for the production and sale of standing timber. Accordingly, the harvesting and sale of logs, the development or sale of certain timberlands and other real estate, the manufacture and sale of wood products and the manufacture and sale of pulp products are conducted through one or more of our wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiaries (TRSs) because such activities could generate non-qualifying REIT income and could constitute

“

prohibited transactions.

”

Prohibited transactions are defined by the Internal Revenue Code generally to be sales or other dispositions of property to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. By conducting our business in this manner we believe that we satisfy the REIT requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and are not subject to the 100 percent tax that could be imposed if a REIT were to conduct a prohibited transaction. The net income of our TRSs is subject to corporate-level income tax.

The extent of our use of our TRS may affect the price of our common shares relative to the share price of other REITs.

We conduct a significant portion of our business activities through one or more TRSs. Our use of our TRSs enables us to engage in non-REIT qualifying business activities such as the sale of logs, production and sale of wood products and pulp products, and sale of HBU property. Our TRSs are subject to corporate-level tax. Therefore, we pay income taxes on the income generated by our TRSs. Under the Code, no more than 25 percent (20 percent after December 31, 2017) of the value of the gross assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRS. This limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our TRSs

’

operations. Furthermore, our use of TRSs may cause the market to value our common shares differently than the shares of other REITs, which may not use TRSs as extensively as we use them.

We may be limited in our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our taxable REIT subsidiaries.

The ability of the REIT to receive dividends from our TRS is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a REIT. In particular, at least 75 percent of gross income for each taxable year as a REIT must be derived from passive real estate sources including sales of our standing timber and other types of qualifying real estate income and no more than 25 percent of our gross income may consist of dividends from our TRS and other non-real estate income.

This limitation on our ability to receive dividends from our TRSs may affect our ability to fund cash distributions to our shareholders using cash flows from our TRSs. The net income of our TRSs is not required to be distributed, and income that is not distributed will not be subject to the REIT income distribution requirement.

Our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate.

Generally, REITs are required to distribute 90 percent of their ordinary taxable income and 95 percent of their net capital gains income. Capital gains may be retained by the REIT, but would be subject to income taxes. If capital gains are retained rather than distributed, our shareholders would be notified and they would be deemed to have received a taxable distribution, with a refundable credit for any federal income tax paid by the REIT. Accordingly, we believe that we are not required to distribute material amounts of cash since substantially all of our taxable income is treated as capital gains income. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, determines the amount of quarterly dividends to be provided to our shareholders based on consideration of a number of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments, future acquisitions and divestitures, harvest levels, changes in the price and demand for our products and general market demand for timberlands including those timberland properties that have higher and better uses. Consequently, our dividend levels may fluctuate.

Changes in tax laws or their interpretation could adversely affect our shareholders and our results of operations.

Federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Department of the Treasury, and state taxing authorities. Changes to tax laws could adversely affect our shareholders or increase our effective tax rates. We cannot predict with certainty whether, when, in what forms, or with what effective dates, the tax laws applicable to us or our shareholders may be changed.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are a party to a number of legal proceedings, and adverse judgments in certain legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

The costs and other effects of pending litigation against us and related insurance recoveries cannot be determined with certainty. Although the disclosure in

Note 15: Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies

of

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

contains management

’

s current views of the effect such litigation will have on our financial results, there can be no assurance that the outcome of such proceedings will be as expected.

It is possible that there could be adverse judgments against us in some or all major litigation against us and that we could be required to take a charge and make cash payments for all or a portion of any damage award. Any such charge or cash payment could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows for the quarter or year in which we record or pay it.

IMPORT/EXPORT TAXES AND DUTIES

We may be required to pay significant taxes on our exported products or countervailing and anti-dumping duties on our imported products.

International trade disputes occur frequently and can be taken to an International Trade Court for resolution of unfair trade practices between countries. As an example, there have been many disputes and subsequent trade agreements regarding sales of softwood lumber between Canada and the United States. The Softwood Lumber Agreement (SLA) between Canada and the U.S., originally signed in October 2006, expired in October 2015. A new agreement has not been reached. The SLA required Canadian softwood lumber facilities, including our mills, to pay an export tax when the price of lumber is at or below a threshold price, which could be as high as 22.5 percent if a province exceeds its total allotted export share, as well as potentially impose additional countervailing antidumping duties. We could experience reduced revenues and margins in any business that is subject to such tariffs or to the terms of the settlements of such international disputes. To the extent such tariffs increase prices, they could also reduce the demand for our products. These tariffs or settlement terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results and financial condition, including facility closures or impairments of assets. We cannot predict whether or when there will be a further extension of the SLA or a new agreement or, if any extension or new agreement is completed, its impact on our business.

DISTRIBUTION OF WRECO SHARES

We could incur substantial U.S. federal tax liability if the WRECO transaction were found not to qualify as a tax-free “reorganization” or the distribution of WRECO shares to Weyerhaeuser shareholders were found not to qualify as a tax-free distribution.

In 2014 we closed the divestiture of our home building business, Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company (WRECO), via a "Reverse Morris Trust" transaction pursuant to which a wholly

-

owned subsidiary of TRI Pointe Homes, Inc. (TRI Pointe) merged with and into WRECO, with WRECO surviving the merger and becoming a wholly

-

owned subsidiary of TRI Pointe. The Reverse Morris Trust transaction was structured to qualify as a tax-free reorganization and the associated distribution of WRECO shares to Weyerhaeuser shareholders as a tax-free distribution. If the transaction were determined not to qualify as a tax-free reorganization

,

or if the distribution does not qualify as a tax-free distribution, then Weyerhaeuser or its subsidiaries or Weyerhaeuser shareholders may be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes.

If the transaction were determined not to qualify as a tax-free reorganization or the distribution not to qualify as a tax-free distribution, or if Weyerhaeuser were required to indemnify TRI Pointe and WRECO, such taxes and indemnification obligations could be substantial and could materially and adversely affect the company’s liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.

OUR MERGER WITH PLUM CREEK TIMBER COMPANY, INC.

The merger may not be completed on the terms currently contemplated, or at all.

On November 6, 2015 Weyerhaeuser Company and Plum Creek Timber Company, Inc. (“Plum Creek”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (“Merger Agreement”) pursuant to which Plum Creek will merge with and into Weyerhaeuser Company with Weyerhaeuser continuing as the surviving corporation. If the merger is not completed, our businesses may be adversely affected and we may be subject to various risks without realizing any of the benefits of having the merger completed, including the following:

•

We may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay a termination fee of $250 million.

•

We may be required to reimburse Plum Creek for all reasonable documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement and the merger up to a maximum of $40 million.

•

We may experience negative reactions from the financial markets or from our customers, suppliers or employees.

•

We may be subject to litigation related to failure to complete the merger or to enforcement proceedings to perform our obligations under the Merger Agreement.

A delay in completing the merger, which is subject to a number of conditions, some of which are outside our control, may reduce or eliminate the expected benefits from the merger.

The merger is subject to a number of conditions, some of which are beyond our control, that could prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect its completion. We cannot predict whether and when the conditions will be satisfied. In addition, several putative class action lawsuits relating to the merger have been filed and additional lawsuits may be filed, which could delay completion of the merger. We intend to vigorously defend the litigation but we cannot predict the outcome. The requirement to obtain certain regulatory approvals could delay the completion of the merger for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. A delay in completing the merger could cause the combined company not to realize some or all of the synergies and other benefits that it expects to achieve if the merger is successfully completed within its expected time frame. The Merger Agreement contains certain restrictions on the conduct of our business. If the merger is delayed, these restrictions could adversely affect our ability to execute business strategies or pursue attractive business opportunities

.

In addition, a delay could cause management to focus on completion of the merger instead of on other opportunities that could be beneficial to the company.

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >

2015 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



The merger will involve substantial costs, and the combined company may be unable to successfully integrate the businesses of the two companies and realize the anticipated benefits of the merger

.

We have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial costs and expenses relating directly to the merger, including fees and expenses payable to financial and other professional advisors, SEC filing fees, printing and mailing costs and other transaction-related costs, fees and expenses. We expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of the businesses

,

policies, procedures, operations, employees, technologies and systems of Plum Creek with those of Weyerhaeuser. There are a large number of systems that must be integrated, including management information, purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, billing, payroll and benefits, fixed asset and lease administration systems and regulatory compliance. Expenses related to this integration are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from the realization of economies of scale and cost savings and synergies related to the integration of the businesses. These integration expenses likely will result in significant charges against earnings following the completion of the merger, but the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain.

The merger involves the combination of two independently operated public companies. The merger will require management to devote significant attention and resources to integrating business practices and operations. The combined company may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the merger if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected.

Uncertainties associated with the merger may adversely affect our business and operations

.

Uncertainties associated with the merger could cause customers, suppliers or other entities with whom we have a business relationship to delay or defer decisions, which could negatively impact our revenues, earnings and cash flows. In addition, customers or suppliers may elect to cease doing business with us or the combined company in anticipation of or following the merger, or seek to take advantage of potential uncertainty or disruption resulting from the merger to interfere with relationships with customers, suppliers or employees.

We are dependent on the valuable experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other employees to execute our business plans and successfully conduct operations. Our success after the merger will depend in part upon our ability to retain key personnel. Current and prospective employees may feel uncertain about their roles following the merger, which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel

.

The market price of our common stock may decline in the future as a result of the merger

.

The market price of our common stock may decline in the future as a result of the merger for a number of reasons, including our inability to successfully integrate the two companies or our failure to achieve the perceived benefits of the merger, including financial results, as rapidly as or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts. Failure to successfully integrate the two companies could negatively impact our revenues, earnings and cash flows, and could materially adversely affect our ability to pay dividends at historical levels, or at all.

The combined company may incur adverse tax consequences if either Weyerhaeuser or Plum Creek has failed or fails to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes

.

Each of Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek has operated in a manner that it believes has allowed it to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the Code. See “REIT Status and Tax Implications” above for a description of the REIT requirements and consequences of failing to maintain REIT status. We intend to operate in a manner that allows us to continue to qualify as a REIT after the merger. However, even if we have operated so as to retain our REIT status, if Plum Creek were to lose its REIT status for a taxable year before the merger or that includes the merger, we will face serious tax consequences that could substantially reduce cash available for distribution to our shareholders and significantly impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital. If the merger were determined not to qualify as a tax-free merger, we could incur substantial federal tax liability that could materially and adversely affect the company's liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.

TIMBERLAND SPECIFIC RISKS

Our ability to harvest and deliver timber may be subject to limitations which could adversely affect our results of operations.

Our primary assets are our timberlands. Weather conditions, timber growth cycles, access limitations, and availability of contract loggers and haulers, may restrict our ability to harvest our timberlands. Other factors that may restrict our timber harvest include damage to our standing timber by fire or by insect infestation, disease, prolonged drought, flooding, severe weather and other natural disasters. Changes in global climate conditions could intensify one or more of these factors. Although damage from such causes usually is localized and affects only a limited percentage of standing timber, there can be no assurance that any damage affecting our timberlands will in fact be limited. As is common in the forest products industry, we do not maintain insurance coverage for damage to our timberlands. Our revenues, net income and cash flow from operations are dependent to a significant extent on the pricing of our products and our continued ability to harvest timber at adequate levels. Therefore, if we were to be restricted from harvesting on a significant portion of our timberlands for a prolonged period of time, or if material damage to a significant portion of our standing timber were to occur, we could suffer a materially adverse impact to our results of operations.

On a short-term basis, we may adjust our timber harvest levels in response to market conditions. Longer term, our timber harvest levels may be affected by acquisitions of additional timberlands, sales of existing timberlands and shifts in harvest from one region to another. In addition to timberland acquisitions and sales, future timber harvest levels may be affected by changes in estimates of long-term sustainable yield because of silvicultural advances, natural disasters, fires, pests, insects and other hazards, regulatory constraints and other factors beyond our control.

Timber harvest activities are also subject to a number of federal, state and local regulations pertaining to the protection of fish, wildlife, water and other resources. Regulations, re-interpretations and litigation can restrict timber harvest activities and increase costs. Examples are federal and state laws protecting threatened, endangered and “at-risk” species, harvesting and forestry road building activities that may be restricted under the U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, state forestry practices laws, laws protecting aboriginal rights, and other similar regulations.

Our estimates of timber inventories and growth rates may be inaccurate, include risks inherent to such estimates, and may impair our ability to realize expected revenues.

We rely upon estimates of merchantable timber inventories, which include judgments regarding inventories that may be lawfully and economically harvested, timber growth rates and end-product yields when acquiring and managing working forests. These estimates, which are inherently inexact and uncertain in nature, are central to forecasting our anticipated timber harvests, revenues and expected cash flows. Timber

growth rates and yield estimates are developed by forest biometricians and other experts using statistical measurements of a sample of trees on a given property. Timber growth equations are used that predict the rate of height and diameter growth of trees so that foresters can estimate the volume of timber that may be present in the tree stand at a given age. Tree growth varies by soil type, geographic area, and climate. Inappropriate application of growth equations in forest management planning may lead to inaccurate estimates of future volumes. If these estimates are inaccurate, our ability to manage our timberlands in a sustainable or profitable manner may be diminished, which may cause our results of operations and our stock price to be adversely affected.

Our operating results and cash flows will be materially affected by supply and demand for timber.

A variety of factors affect prices for timber, including available supply, changes in economic conditions that impact demand, the level of domestic new construction and remodeling activity, interest rates, credit availability, population growth, weather conditions and pest infestation, and other factors. These factors vary by region, timber type (sawlogs or pulpwood logs) and species.

Timber prices are affected by changes in demand on a local, national or international level. The closure of a mill in the regions where we own timber can have a material adverse effect on demand, and therefore pricing. As the demand for paper continues to decline, closures of pulp mills have adversely affected the demand for pulpwood and wood chips in certain regions in which we operate. We export logs to Asia. While demand for Asia has remained steady, recently Asian markets have experienced a high degree of volatility, especially in China. A decrease in demand of logs from Asia may have a negative impact on log and lumber in the markets in which we compete.

Timber prices are affected by changes in timber availability at the local, national and international level. Our timberland ownership is concentrated in Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon and Washington. In some of these states, much of the timberland is privately owned. Increases in timber prices often result in substantial increases in harvesting on private timberlands, including lands not previously made available for commercial timber operations, causing a short-term increase in supply that moderates price increases. In western states such as Oregon, and Washington, where a greater proportion of timberland is government owned, any substantial increase in timber harvesting from government-owned land could significantly reduce timber prices. On a local level, timber supplies can fluctuate depending upon factors such as changes in weather conditions and harvest strategies of local timberland owners, as well as occasionally high timber salvage efforts due to events such as unusual pest infestations or fires.

Timberlands make up a significant portion of our business portfolio.

Our real estate holdings are primarily timberlands and we may make additional timberlands acquisitions in the future. As the owner and manager of approximately 6.9 million acres of timberlands, we are subject to the risks that are inherent in concentrated real estate investments. A downturn in the real estate industry generally, or the timber or forest products industries specifically, could reduce the value of our properties and adversely affect our results of operations. Such a downturn could also adversely affect our customers and reduce the demand for our products. The risks we face may be more pronounced than if we diversified our investments outside real estate or outside timberlands.

CYBERSECURITY RISKS

We rely on information technology to support our operations and reporting environments. A security failure of that technology could impact our ability to operate our businesses effectively, adversely affect our reported financial results, impact our reputation and expose us to potential liability or litigation.

We use information systems to carry out our operational activities and maintain our business records. Some systems are internally managed and some are maintained by third-party service providers. We and our service providers employ what we believe are adequate security measures. Our ability to conduct business could be materially and adversely affected if these systems or resources are compromised, damaged or fail. This could be a result of a cyber incident, natural disaster, hardware or software corruption, failure or error, telecommunications system failure, service provider error or failure, intentional or unintentional personnel actions or other disruption.

In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, other proprietary information and personally identifiable information. If this data is compromised, destroyed or inappropriately disclosed, it could have a material adverse effect, including damage to our reputation, loss of customers, significant expenses to address and resolve the issues, or litigation or other proceedings by affected individuals, business partners and/or regulators.

In addition, there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies operating in the forest products industry that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.

Some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought against them. If litigation of this type is brought against us, it could result in substantial costs and divert management

PREFERENCE SHARES

Our common shares will rank junior to our mandatory convertible preference shares with respect to dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation.

Our common shares will rank junior to our mandatory convertible preference shares with respect to the payment of dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up. This means that, unless full cumulative dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding mandatory convertible preference shares for all past dividend periods and the then current dividend period, no dividends may be declared or paid on our common shares. Likewise, in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, no distribution of our assets may be made to holders of our common shares until we have paid to holders of the mandatory convertible preference shares a liquidation preference equal to $50.00 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends.

Certain provisions in the mandatory convertible preference shares could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover or takeover attempt of us and, therefore, the ability of holders to exercise their rights associated with a potential fundamental change.

Certain provisions in our mandatory convertible preference shares could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, if a fundamental change were to occur on or prior to July 1, 2016, holders of the mandatory convertible preference shares may have the right to convert their mandatory convertible preference shares, in whole or in part, at an increased conversion rate and be entitled to receive a fundamental change dividend make-whole amount equal to the present value of all remaining dividend payments on their mandatory convertible preference shares. These features of the mandatory convertible preference shares could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management.
