RISK FACTORS

We are subject to certain risks and events that, if one or more of them occur, could adversely affect our business, our financial condition, our results of operations and the trading price of our common stock.

You should consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information presented in this report and the matters described in “

Forward-Looking Statements

,” as well as the other reports and registration statements we file from time to time with the SEC, in evaluating us, our business and an investment in our securities.

The risks below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely affect our business.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRIES AND BUSINESS

MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS

The industries in which we operate are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions and consequently highly cyclical.

The overall levels of demand for the products we manufacture and distribute reflect fluctuations in levels of end-user demand which consequently impact our sales and profitability. End-user demand depends in part on general macroeconomic conditions in North America and worldwide as well as on local economic conditions. Current economic conditions in the United States reflect growth below historical trends, moderately improving consumer confidence and general business uncertainty, fueled by fiscal concerns within the U.S. as well as global economic issues such as slowing growth and rising inflation in emerging countries. The homebuilding industry (including our Real Estate business), has recently experienced increased demand for new homes resulting in falling inventories, which contributed to some improvement in selling prices for new and existing homes. This improvement is highly dependent on continued improvement in the overall economy, the relative health of which has been subject to the numerous shocks and obstacles, including those mentioned earlier. Our Wood Products segment is highly dependent on the strength of the homebuilding industry. The decline in home construction activity over the past several years, which occurred as a result of the credit bubble and recession, resulted in depressed prices of and demand for wood products and building materials. This was reflected in lower prices and demand for logs and reduced harvests in our Timberland segment. The length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time and by product, but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions. Those conditions improved recently for some sectors such as homebuilding and wood products, while other sectors such as cellulose fibers have been adversely impacted by the slowdown in global economic growth, as this is a major driver of demand for products made from cellulose fibers.

COMMODITY PRODUCTS

Many of our products are commodities that are widely available from other producers.

Because commodity products have few distinguishing properties from producer to producer, competition for these products is based primarily on price, which is determined by supply relative to demand and competition from substitute products. Prices for our products are affected by many factors outside of our control, and we have no influence over the timing and extent of price changes, which often are volatile. Our profitability with respect to these products depends, in part, on managing our costs, particularly raw material and energy costs, which represent significant components of our operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control. Prices of and demand for many of our products have fluctuated significantly in recent quarters, while many of our raw material or energy costs have increased. As a result, both sales and profitability are subject to volatility due to market forces beyond our control.

INDUSTRY SUPPLY OF LOGS, WOOD PRODUCTS AND PULP

Excess supply of products may adversely affect prices and margins.

Oversupply of products also may result from producers introducing new capacity or increasing harvest levels in response to favorable short-term pricing trends. Industry supplies of pulp also are influenced by overseas production capacity, which has grown in recent years and is expected to continue to grow. While the weakness of the U.S. dollar in recent years has improved the company

’

s competitive position, the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar and decreases in demand for consumer products in emerging markets may result in lower prices. Continuation of these factors could materially and adversely affect sales volumes and margins of our operations..

HOMEBUILDING MARKET AND ECONOMIC RISKS

High unemployment, low demand and low levels of consumer confidence can adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Many of our businesses are dependent upon the health of the U.S. housing market. Demand for homes is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as the level of employment, consumer confidence, consumer income, the availability of financing and interest rate levels. The legacy of the housing bubble, its collapse and ensuing credit crisis has been one of tightened credit requirements and a reduced number of mortgage loans available for financing home purchases. Credit conditions have begun to ease, but remain significantly more restrictive than prior to the housing bubble. Demand for new homes also has been adversely affected by factors such as continued high unemployment and weak consumer confidence. Additionally, rising student loan debt among younger adults is limiting access to mortgage financing and home ownership. Foreclosure rates and distress sales of houses, while still at elevated levels, have fallen and are less of an impact compared to the years immediately following the housing collapse.

Homebuyers

’

ability to qualify for and obtain affordable mortgages could be affected by changes in government sponsored entities and private mortgage insurance companies supporting the mortgage market.

The federal government has historically had a significant role in supporting mortgage lending through its sponsorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. As a result of turbulence in the credit markets and mortgage finance industry in the last few years, the effect of the federal government

’

s conservatorship of these government sponsored entities on the short-term and long-term demand for new housing remains unclear.

The liquidity provided to the mortgage industry by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both of which purchase home mortgages and mortgage-backed securities originated by mortgage lenders, is critical to the housing market. There have been significant concerns about the future purpose of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and a number of proposals to curtail their activities over time are under review. Any limitations or restrictions on the availability

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >

2013 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



of financing by these entities could adversely affect interest rates, mortgage financing, and increase the effective cost of our homes, which could reduce demand for our homes and adversely affect our results of operations.

Changes in mortgage interest expense and real estate tax regulations could harm our future sales and earnings.

Significant costs of homeownership include mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes, both of which are generally deductible for an individual

’

s federal and, in some cases, state income taxes. Any changes to income tax laws by the federal government or a state government to eliminate or substantially reduce these income tax deductions, as has been considered from time to time, would increase the after-tax cost of owning a home. Increases in real estate taxes by local governmental authorities also increase the cost of homeownership. Any such increases to the cost of homeownership could adversely affect the demand for and sales prices of new homes.

CAPITAL MARKETS

Deterioration in economic conditions and the credit markets could adversely affect our access to capital.

Upset financial or credit market conditions can impair the company

’

s ability to borrow money or otherwise access credit markets on terms acceptable to us, which may, among other impacts, reduce our ability to take advantage of growth and expansion opportunities. Similarly, our customers may be unable to borrow money to fund their operations. Similarly, deteriorating or volatile market conditions could have an adverse effect on our customers and suppliers and their ability to purchase our products or sell products to us.

CHANGES IN CREDIT RATINGS

Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.

Credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results, actions that we take, their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy. Actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining, upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing the company on a watch list for possible future downgrading. Downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading could limit our access to the credit markets, increase our cost of financing, and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.

SUBSTITUTION

Some of our products are vulnerable to declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials.

Our products may compete with nonfiber-based alternatives or with alternative products in certain market segments. For example, plastic, wood/plastic or composite materials may be used by builders as alternatives to the products produced by our Wood Products businesses such as lumber, veneer, plywood and oriented strand board. Changes in prices for oil, chemicals and wood-based fiber can change the competitive position of our products relative to available alternatives and could increase substitution of those products for our products. As the use of these alternatives grows, demand for our products may further decline.

CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX OR PRICING

Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by changes in product mix or pricing.

Our results may be adversely affected by a change in our product mix or pricing. If we are not successful in implementing previously announced or future price increases, or plans to move customers to higher-priced products, or if there are delays in acceptance of price increases or failure of customers to accept higher-priced products our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Moreover, price discounting, if required to maintain our competitive position, could result in lower than anticipated price realizations.

INTENSE COMPETITION

We face intense competition in our markets, and the failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We compete with North American and, for many of our product lines, global producers, some of which may have greater financial resources and lower production costs than we do. The principal basis for competition for many of our products is selling price. Our ability to maintain satisfactory margins depends in large part on our ability to control our costs. Our industries also are particularly sensitive to other factors including innovation, design, quality and service, with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line. To the extent that one or more of our competitors become more successful with respect to any key competitive factor, our ability to attract and retain customers could be materially adversely affected. If we are unable to compete effectively, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Another emerging form of competition is between brands of sustainably produced products; customer demand for certain brands could reduce competition among buyers for our products or cause other adverse effects.

In North America, our forests are third party-certified to the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI

®

) standard. Some of our customers have expressed a preference in certain of our product lines for products made from raw materials sourced from forests certified to different standards, including standards of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). If and to the extent that this preference becomes a customer requirement, there may be reduced demand and lower prices for our products relative to competitors who can supply products sourced from forests certified to competing certification standards. If we seek to comply with such other standards, we could incur materially increased costs for our operations or be required to reduce harvest levels. FSC, in particular, employs standards that are geographically variable and could cause a material reduction in the harvest levels of some of our timberlands, most notably in the Pacific Northwest.

2013 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



MATERIAL DISRUPTION OF MANUFACTURING

A material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales or negatively affect our results of operation and financial condition.

Any of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including:

•

unscheduled maintenance outages,

•

prolonged power failures,

•

equipment failure,

•

a chemical spill or release,

•

explosion of a boiler,

•

the effect of a drought or reduced rainfall on its water supply,

•

labor difficulties,

•

disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railroad tracks and tunnels,

•

fires, floods, windstorms, earthquakes, hurricanes or other catastrophes,

•

terrorism or threats of terrorism,

•

governmental regulations, and

•

other operational problems.

Any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products or require us to make unplanned capital expenditures. If one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime, our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired, resulting in lower sales and income.

STRATEGIC INITIATIVES

Our business and financial results may be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully execute on important strategic initiatives.

There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations, which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results. These strategic initiatives are designed to improve our results of operations and drive long-term shareholder value, and include, among others: maximizing cash flow through operational excellence; reducing costs to achieve industry-leading cost structure; and innovating in higher-margin products

.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

Our operations require substantial capital.

The company has substantial capital requirements for expansion and repair or replacement of existing facilities or equipment. Although we maintain our production equipment with regular scheduled maintenance, key pieces of equipment may need to be repaired or replaced periodically. The costs of repairing or replacing such equipment and the associated downtime of the affected production line could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We believe our capital resources will be adequate to meet our current projected operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements. If for any reason we are unable to provide for our operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements on economic terms, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS

We could incur substantial costs as a result of compliance with, violations of, or liabilities under applicable environmental laws and other laws and regulations.

We are subject to a wide range of general and industry-specific laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing:

•

air emissions,

•

wastewater discharges,

•

harvesting and other silvicultural activities,

•

forestry operations and endangered species habitat protection,

•

surface water management,

•

the storage, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes,

•

the cleanup of contaminated sites,

•

landfill operation and closure obligations,

•

building codes, and

•

health and safety matters.

For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is in the process of implementing final rules regulating greenhouse gases that apply to our operations on a project-by-project basis and may be applied to carbon dioxide emissions from biomass. These and similar laws and regulations in the U.S. and Canada will require us to obtain authorizations from and comply with the authorization requirements of the appropriate governmental authorities, which have considerable discretion over the terms and timing of permits.

We have incurred, and we expect to continue to incur, significant capital, operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations and as a result of remedial obligations. We also could incur substantial costs, such as civil or criminal fines, sanctions and enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment or other remedial actions), cleanup and closure costs, and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations.

As the owner and operator of real estate, including in our homebuilding business, we may be liable under environmental laws for cleanup, closure and other damages resulting from the presence and release of hazardous substances on or from our properties or operations. In

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >

2013 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



addition, surface water management regulations may present liabilities and are subject to change. The amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict, and in some cases, our liability may exceed forecasted amounts or the value of the property itself. The discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at our sites or third-party sites may result in significant additional costs. Any material liability we incur could adversely affect our financial condition or preclude us from making capital expenditures that otherwise would benefit our business.

We also anticipate public policy developments at the state, federal and international level regarding climate change and energy access, security and competitiveness. We expect these developments to address emission of carbon dioxide, renewable energy and fuel standards, and the monetization of carbon. Compliance with regulations that implement new public policy in these areas might require significant expenditures. These developments may also include mandated changes to energy use and building codes which could affect our homebuilding practices. Enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the interpretation of these laws or regulations, might require significant expenditures. We also anticipate public policy developments at the state, federal and international level regarding taxes, health care and a number of other areas that could require significant expenditures.

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES

We will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates.

We have manufacturing operations in Canada, Poland, Uruguay and Brazil. We are also a large exporter and compete with producers of products very similar to ours. Therefore, we are affected by changes in the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar, euro and yen, and the strength of the euro relative to the yen.

AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS AND ENERGY

Our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials and energy.

We rely heavily on certain raw materials (principally wood fiber and chemicals) and energy sources (principally natural gas, electricity, coal and fuel oil) in our manufacturing processes. Our ability to increase earnings has been, and will continue to be, affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials and energy sources. We may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material or energy costs through hedging arrangements, price increases, productivity improvements or cost-reduction programs.

PEOPLE

Our business is dependent upon attracting, retaining and developing key personnel.

We believe that our success depends, to a significant extent, upon our ability to attract, retain and develop key senior management and operations management personnel. Our failure to recruit, retain, and develop these key personnel could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.

TRANSPORTATION

We depend on third parties for transportation services and increases in costs and the availability of transportation could materially adversely affect our business and operations.

Our business depends on the transportation of a large number of products, both domestically and internationally. We rely primarily on third parties for transportation of the products we manufacture or distribute as well as delivery of our raw materials. In particular, a significant portion of the goods we manufacture and raw materials we use are transported by railroad or trucks, which are highly regulated.

If any of our third-party transportation providers were to fail to deliver the goods we manufacture or distribute in a timely manner, we may be unable to sell those products at full value, or at all. Similarly, if any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner, we may be unable to manufacture our products in response to customer demand. In addition, if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us, we may be unable to replace them at reasonable cost.

Any failure of a third-party transportation provider to deliver raw materials or finished products in a timely manner could harm our reputation, negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.

In addition, an increase in transportation rates or fuel surcharges could materially adversely affect our sales and profitability.

REIT STATUS AND TAX IMPLICATIONS

If we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, our taxable income would be subject to tax at corporate rates and we would not be able to deduct dividends to shareholders.

In any taxable year in which we fail to qualify as a REIT, unless we are entitled to relief under the Internal Revenue Code:

•

We would not be allowed to deduct dividends to shareholders in computing our taxable income.

•

We would be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates.

•

We also would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost qualification.

Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our operations and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. There are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions. Although we operate in a manner consistent with the REIT qualification rules, we cannot assure you that we are or will remain so qualified.

In addition, federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Department of the Treasury, and state taxing authorities. Changes to the tax law could adversely affect our shareholders. We cannot predict with certainty whether, when, in what forms, or with what effective dates, the tax laws applicable to us or our shareholders may be changed.

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY >

2013 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



Certain of our business activities are subject to corporate-level income tax and potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax

.

Under the Internal Revenue Code, REITs generally must engage in the ownership and management of income producing real estate. For the Company, this generally includes owning and managing a timberland portfolio for the production and sale of standing timber. Accordingly, the manufacture and sale by us of wood products, the harvesting and sale of logs, and the development or sale of certain timberlands, the manufacture and sale of pulp products, the development of real estate, the building and sale of single-family houses and the development and sale of land and lots for real estate development are conducted through one or more of our wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiaries (TRSs) because such activities could generate non-qualifying REIT income and could constitute

“

prohibited transactions.

”

Prohibited transactions are defined by the Internal Revenue Code generally to be sales or other dispositions of property to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. By conducting our business in this manner we believe that we satisfy the REIT requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and are not subject to the 100 percent tax that could be imposed if a REIT were to conduct a prohibited transaction. The net income of our TRSs is subject to corporate-level income tax.

The extent of our use of our TRS may affect the price of our common shares relative to the share price of other REITs.

We conduct a significant portion of our business activities through one or more TRSs. Our use of our TRSs enables us to engage in non-REIT qualifying business activities such as the sale of logs, production and sale of wood products and pulp products, real estate development and single-family home sales, and sale of HBU property. Our TRSs are subject to corporate-level tax. Therefore, we pay income taxes on the income generated by our TRSs. Under the Code, no more than 25 percent of the value of the gross assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRS. This limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our TRSs

’

operations. Furthermore, our use of TRSs may cause the market to value our common shares differently than the shares of other REITs, which may not use TRSs as extensively as we use them.

We may be limited in our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our taxable REIT subsidiaries.

The ability of the REIT to receive dividends from our TRS is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a REIT. In particular, at least 75 percent of gross income for each taxable year as a REIT must be derived from passive real estate sources including sales of our standing timber and other types of qualifying real estate income and no more than 25 percent of our gross income may consist of dividends from our TRS and other non-real estate income.

This limitation on our ability to receive dividends from our TRSs may affect our ability to fund cash distributions to our shareholders using cash flows from our TRSs. The net income of our TRSs is not required to be distributed, and income that is not distributed will not be subject to the REIT income distribution requirement.

Our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate.

Generally, REITs are required to distribute 90 percent of their ordinary taxable income and 95 percent of their net capital gains income. Capital gains may be retained by the REIT, but would be subject to income taxes. If capital gains are retained rather than distributed, our shareholders would be notified and they would be deemed to have received a taxable distribution, with a refundable credit for any federal income tax paid by the REIT. Accordingly, we believe that we are not required to distribute material amounts of cash since substantially all of our taxable income is treated as capital gains income. Our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, determines the amount of quarterly dividends to be provided to our shareholders based on consideration of a number of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments, future acquisitions and divestitures, harvest levels, changes in the price and demand for our products and general market demand for timberlands including those timberland properties that have higher and better uses. Consequently, our dividend levels may fluctuate.

We may not be able to complete desired like-kind exchange transactions for timberlands and real estate we sell.

When we sell timberlands and real estate, we generally seek to match these sales with the acquisition of suitable replacement timberlands. This allows us

“

like-kind exchange

”

treatment for these transactions under section 1031 and related regulations of the Code. This matching of sales and purchases provides us with significant tax benefits, most importantly the deferral of any gain on the property sold until ultimate disposition of the replacement property. While we attempt to complete like-kind exchanges wherever practical, we may not be able to do so in all instances due to various factors, including the lack of availability of suitable replacement property on acceptable terms and our inability to complete a qualifying like-kind exchange transaction within the time frames required by the Code. The inability to obtain like-kind exchange treatment would result in the payment of taxes with respect to the property sold, and a corresponding reduction in earnings and cash available for distribution to shareholders as dividends.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are a party to a number of legal proceedings, and adverse judgments in certain legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

The costs and other effects of pending litigation against us and related insurance recoveries cannot be determined with certainty. Although the disclosure in

Note 17: Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies

of

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

contains management

’

s current views of the effect such litigation will have on our financial results, there can be no assurance that the outcome of such proceedings will be as expected.

It is possible that there could be adverse judgments against us in some or all major litigation against us and that we could be required to take a charge and make cash payments for all or a portion of any damage award. Any such charge or cash payment could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows for the quarter or year in which we record or pay it.

2013 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K



EXPORT TAXES

We may be required to pay significant export taxes or countervailing and anti-dumping duties for exported products.

We may experience reduced revenues and margins on some of our businesses as a result of export taxes or countervailing and anti-dumping duty assessments. International trade disputes occur frequently and can be taken to an International Trade Court for resolution of unfair trade practices between countries. For example, there have been many disputes and subsequent trade agreements regarding sales of softwood lumber between Canada and the United States. The current Softwood Lumber Act signed in October 2006 requires our Canadian softwood lumber facilities to pay an export tax when the price of lumber is at or below a threshold price. The export tax could be as high as 22.5

percent if a province exceeds its total allotted export share. It is possible that additional countervailing duty and antidumping tariffs, or similar type tariffs could be imposed on us in the future. We may experience reduced revenues and margins in any business that is subject to such tariffs or to the terms of the settlements of such international disputes. These tariffs or settlement terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results and financial condition, including facility closures or impairments of assets.

NATURAL DISASTERS

Our business and operations could be adversely affected by weather, fire, infestation or natural disasters.

Our timberlands assets may be damaged by adverse weather, severe wind and rainstorms, fires, pest infestation or other natural disasters. Because our manufacturing processes primarily use wood fiber, in many cases from our own timberlands, in the event of material damage to our timberlands, our operations could be disrupted or our production costs could be increased. As is typical in the forestry industry, we do not insure against losses of timber, including losses due to these causes.

ACQUISITION OF LONGVIEW TIMBER LLC

We may fail to realize the full benefits anticipated as a result of the acquisition of Longview Timber LLC.

There are a number of risks and uncertainties relating to our recent acquisition of Longview Timber LLC. The ultimate success of the acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities and growth prospects from combining our businesses with those of Longview Timber. We may not fully realize our expected business opportunities, synergies and growth prospects. Integrating operations may require significant efforts and expenditures from us. We may also be required to make unanticipated capital expenditures or investments in order to maintain, improve or sustain the operations or assets of Longview Timber or take write-offs or impairment charges or recognize amortization expenses resulting from the acquisition and may be subject to unanticipated or unknown liabilities relating to Longview Timber and its business. If any of these factors limit our ability to fully integrate the businesses successfully or on a timely basis, the expectations of future results of operations following the acquisition might not be met.

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION

The Real Estate transaction may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all.

On November 4, 2013, we announced that the Company and Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (

“

WRECO

”

), had entered into a Transaction Agreement dated November 3, 2013 with TRI Pointe Homes, Inc. ("TRI Pointe") and one of TRI Pointe

’

s subsidiaries (

“

Merger Sub

”

)

.

Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, Weyerhaeuser Company will distribute all the shares of common stock of WRECO to its shareholders (i) on a pro rata basis, (ii) in an exchange offer or (iii) in a combination thereof (the

“

Distribution

”

). Immediately following the Distribution, Merger Sub will merge with and into WRECO (the

“

Merger

”

), with WRECO surviving the Merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of TRI Pointe.

The consummation of the transaction is subject to numerous conditions, including (i) consummation of certain financings and transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreement, (ii) the receipt of TRI Pointe stockholder approval, (iii) the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals, (iv) the receipt of certain tax opinions, and (v) other customary closing conditions. We can make no assurances that the transaction will be consummated on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all. We have and will continue to expend significant management time and resources and incur significant expenses due to legal, advisory and financial services fees related to the transaction.

RISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK

STOCK-PRICE VOLATILITY

The market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including those described above under "

Risks Related to our Industries and Business

" and the following:

•

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or our competitors' operating results,

•

announcements by us or our competitors of new products, capacity changes, significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments,

•

our growth rate and our competitors

’

growth rates,

•

the financial market and general economic conditions,

•

changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding us, our competitors or the forest products industry generally, or lack of analyst coverage of our common stock,

•

sales of our common stock by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders or sales of substantial amounts of common stock,

•

changes in accounting principles, and

•

changes in tax laws and regulations.

In addition, there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies operating in the forest products industry that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.

Some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought against them. If litigation of this type is brought against us, it could result in substantial costs and would divert management

’

s attention and resources.

PREFERENCE SHARES

Our common shares will rank junior to our mandatory convertible preference shares with respect to dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation.

Our common shares will rank junior to our mandatory convertible preference shares with respect to the payment of dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up. This means that, unless full cumulative dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding mandatory convertible preference shares for all past dividend periods and the then current dividend period, no dividends may be declared or paid on our common shares. Likewise, in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, no distribution of our assets may be made to holders of our common shares until we have paid to holders of the mandatory convertible preference shares a liquidation preference equal to $50.00 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends.

Certain provisions in the mandatory convertible preference shares could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover or takeover attempt of us and, therefore, the ability of holders to exercise their rights associated with a potential fundamental change.

Certain provisions in our mandatory convertible preference shares could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, if a fundamental change were to occur on or prior to July 1, 2016, holders of the mandatory convertible preference shares may have the right to convert their mandatory convertible preference shares, in whole or in part, at an increased conversion rate and will also be entitled to receive a fundamental change dividend make-whole amount equal to the present value of all remaining dividend payments on their mandatory convertible preference shares. These features of the mandatory convertible preference shares could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management.
