ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS





Risks Relating to our Business



Our net revenues are dependent primarily on our Invisalign System and iTero Scanners and any decline in sales or average selling price of these products for any reason, would adversely affect net revenues, gross margin and net income.



Our net revenues are largely dependent on the sales of our Invisalign System of clear aligners and iTero intraoral scanners.  Of the two, we expect net revenues from the sale of the Invisalign System, primarily our comprehensive products, will continue to account for the vast majority of our net revenues for the foreseeable future. Continued and widespread acceptance of the Invisalign System by orthodontists, GPs and consumers is critical to our future success. Our iTero scanners are used by dental professionals for restorative and orthodontic procedures as well as Invisalign System case submissions.  Sales of our iTero scanners are continuing to grow, becoming a larger percentage of our overall revenues and as a means to further adoption of digital dentistry and the Invisalign System.  If orthodontists and GPs experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services, if consumers prove unwilling to adopt Invisalign System treatment as rapidly or in the volumes we anticipate and at the prices offered, if orthodontists or GPs choose to use wires and brackets or competitive products rather than Invisalign, if sales of our iTero scanners decline or fail to grow sufficiently or as expected, or if the average selling price of our products decline for any reason, particularly in the case of our Invisalign System as a result of a shift in product mix towards lower priced products or as a result of promotions, or competition, our operating results would be harmed.



Competition in the markets for our products is increasing and we expect aggressive competition from existing competitors and other companies that may introduce new technologies in the future.



The dental industry is in a period of immense and rapid transformation involving products, technologies, distribution channels and business models, much of which is based on digital transformation involving information technology, data, artificial intelligence, scanning, 3D printing, software and algorithms. While our clear aligner and iTero scanners facilitate this transition, there remains significant uncertainty concerning the technologies that will achieve market acceptance and, if adopted, whether and when they may become obsolete as new offerings become available.





The manipulation and movement of teeth and bone is a delicate process with potentially painful and debilitating results if not appropriately performed and monitored. Accordingly, we remain committed to delivering our solutions primarily through trained and skilled doctors. Invisalign Treatment requires a doctor's prescription and an in person physical examination of the patient’s dentition before beginning treatment. However, with the advent of DTC providers accompanied by significant advertising










campaigns, there has been some shifting away from traditional practices that may impact our primary selling channels. We also believe doctors are sampling alternative products and/or taking advantage of wires and brackets bundles that essentially give clear aligners away for free or at reduced prices. In addition, we may also face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new technologies. We may be unable to compete with these competitors or one or more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive. If we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any new technologies, our business could be harmed. Increased competition has resulted in the past and may in the future result in volume discounting and price reductions, reduced gross margins and profitability, loss of market share, and result in the reduction of dental professionals’ efforts and commitment to use our products, any of which could materially adversely affect our net revenues, volume growth, net income and stock price. We cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.



We are dependent on our international operations, which exposes us to foreign operational, political and other risks that may harm our business.



Our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the U.S. Technicians use a sophisticated, internally developed computer-modeling program to prepare digital clinical treatment plans (“ClinCheck”), which are then transmitted electronically to our aligner fabrication facilities. These digital files form the basis of the ClinCheck treatment plan and are used to manufacture aligner molds and aligners. Our digital treatment planning and aligner fabrication are performed in multiple international locations and we are continuing to establish these functions closer to our international customers to improve doctor and patient experiences and our operational efficiency. Also, in addition to research and development efforts conducted in the U.S., Russia and Israel, we have operations in Israel and China where we assemble wands, and our intraoral scanner is manufactured. Our reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operation, including:



•difficulties in hiring and retaining employees generally, as well as difficulties in hiring and retaining employees with the necessary skills to perform the more technical aspects of our operations;

•difficulties in managing international operations, including any travel restrictions on us or our customers such as those recently imposed in China in response to the Novel Coronavirus epidemic;

•fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

•import and export controls, license requirements and restrictions;

•controlling production volume and quality of the manufacturing process;

•political, social and economic instability, including increased levels of violence in Juarez, Mexico, Hong Kong or the Middle East. We cannot predict the effect on us of any future armed conflict, political instability or violence in these regions. In addition, some of our employees in Israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israeli military and may be called for additional active duty under emergency circumstances. We cannot predict the full impact of these conditions on us, particularly if emergency circumstances or an escalation in political situations occur. If many of our employees are called for active duty, our operations in Israel and our business may not be able to function at full capacity;

•acts of terrorism and acts of war;

•general geopolitical instability and the responses to it, such as the possibility of sanctions, trade restrictions and changes in tariffs, including recent sanctions against China and Russia and tariffs imposed by the U.S. and China and the possibility of additional tariffs or other trade restrictions between the U.S. and Mexico;

•interruptions and limitations in telecommunication services;

•product or material transportation delays or disruption, including as a result of customs clearance, violence, protests, police and military actions, or as a result of natural disasters, such as earthquakes or volcanic eruptions;

•burdens of complying with a wide variety of regional and local laws, including competition and anti-bribery laws;

•the impact of government-led initiatives to encourage the purchase or support of domestic vendors, which can affect the willingness of customers to purchase products from, or collaborate to promote interoperability of products with, companies whose headquarters or primarily operations are not domestic;

•unexpected issues and expenses related to our corporate structure reorganization;

•reduced intellectual property rights protections as compared to the U.S;

•longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection; and

•potential adverse tax consequences.



The United Kingdom’s (“U.K.”) withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020, commonly known as “Brexit,” has exacerbated and may further exacerbate many of the risks and uncertainties described above. The withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU could, among other potential outcomes, adversely affect the tax, tax treaty, currency, operational, legal and regulatory regimes to which our businesses in the region are subject. The withdrawal could also, among other potential outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the U.K. and the EU and significantly disrupt trade between the U.K. and the EU and other parties. Further, uncertainty around these and related issues could lead to adverse effects on the economy of the U.K., EU and the










other economies in which we operate. As the withdrawal continues to unfold, the actual implications of Brexit in their entirety are unlikely to be known for years.



If any of the risks outlined above materialize in the future, we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenues.



We earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales and face risks attendant to those operations.



We earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales generated through our foreign direct and indirect operations. Since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to penetrate international markets and increase the localization of our products and services, we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the U.S., particularly in markets we believe to have high-growth potential. Our international operations are subject to risks that are customarily encountered in non-U.S. operations, including:



•local political and economic instability;

•the engagement of activities by our employees, contractors, partners and agents, especially in countries with developing economies, that are prohibited by international and local trade and labor laws and other laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and export control laws, in spite of our policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws;

•fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

•increased expense of developing, testing and making localized versions of our products; and

•health pandemics such as the new coronavirus in China and natural disasters including weather and fires such as those common in California and recently in Australia.



Any of these factors, either individually or in combination, could materially impact our international operations and adversely affect our business as a whole.



Demand for our products may not increase as rapidly as we anticipate due to a variety of factors including a weakness in general economic conditions and resistance to non-traditional treatment methods.





Our success may depend on our ability to develop, successfully introduce and achieve market acceptance of new products or product offerings.



Our success depends on our ability to profitably develop, manufacture, market and obtain regulatory approval or clearance of new products and improvements to existing products. There is no assurance we can successfully develop, sell and achieve market acceptance of new or improved products and services. The extent of, and rate at which, market acceptance and penetration are achieved by new or future products or offerings is a function of many variables, which include, among other things, our ability to:



•correctly predict, timely develop and cost effectively manufacture or bring to market solutions that meet future customer needs and preferences with the features and functionality they desire or expect;

•allocate our research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects;

•ensure compatibility of our computer operating systems and hardware configurations with those of our customers;

•anticipate and rapidly respond to new competitive products, product offerings and technological innovations;










•differentiate our products and product offerings from our competitors as well as other products in our own portfolio and successfully articulate the benefits of those differences to our customers;

•innovate and develop new technologies and applications;

•the availability of third-party reimbursement of procedures using our products;

•obtain and protect adequate intellectual property rights; and

•encourage customers to adopt new technologies.



If we fail to accurately predict customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenues. Even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and product enhancements, we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer. In addition, even if our new products are successfully introduced, it may be difficult to gain market share and acceptance, particularly if doctors require education to understand the benefits of the new products or measure their success only after extended periods of time required to treat patients. For instance, it can take up to 24 months or longer to treat patients using our Invisalign System. Similarly, we recently introduced our mandibular advancement treatment and expect it will require significant time and effort on our part to educate doctors to the benefits of this treatment method. Consequently, doctors may be unwilling to rapidly adopt our new products until they successfully complete at least one case or until more historical clinical results are available.



Our ability to market and sell new products may also be subject to government regulation, including approval or clearance by the FDA and foreign government agencies. Any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce or achieve market acceptance of our new products or enhanced versions of existing products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our net revenues to decline.



We may experience declines in average selling prices of our products which may decrease our net revenues.



We provide volume-based discount programs to our customers. In addition, we sell a number of products at different list prices which also differ based on regions and or country. If we change volume-based discount programs affecting our average selling prices; if we introduce any price reductions or consumer rebate programs; if we expand our discount programs or participation in these programs increases; if our critical accounting estimates materially differ from actual behavior or results; or if our geographic, channel, or product mix shifts to lower priced products or to products that have a  higher percentage of deferred revenue, our average selling prices would be adversely affected. Moreover, we may find that some programs are unsuccessful or, even if successful may drive demand in unexpected ways. Were any of the foregoing to occur, our net revenues, gross profit, gross margin and net income may be reduced.



We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.



Although the U.S. dollar is our reporting currency, a growing portion of our net revenues and net income are generated in foreign currencies. Net revenues and net income generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the U.S. are translated into U.S. dollars using constantly fluctuating, often substantially, exchange rates during the respective period. As a result, negative movements in exchange rates against the U.S. dollar have and may increasingly adversely affect our net revenues and net income in our consolidated financial statements. We enter into currency forward contract transactions in an effort to cover some of our exposure to currency fluctuations but there is no assurance these transactions will fully or effectively hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations, and, under certain circumstances, these transactions could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.



As we continue to grow, we are subject to growth related risks, including risks related to excess or constrained capacity and operational inefficiencies at our manufacturing and treat facilities.












overall business. In addition, because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions, our facility capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements. If product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would lower our gross margin. Production of our intraoral scanners may also be limited by capacity constraints due to a variety of factors, including our dependency on third party vendors for key components in addition to limited production yields. Any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise harm our business and financial results.



If we fail to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods, our profitability may decline.



If we are to sustain or increase profitability in future periods, we need to continue increasing our net revenues, while controlling expenses. Because our business is evolving, it is difficult to predict our future operating results or levels of growth, and we have not in the past and may be unable in the future to sustain our historical growth rates which may cause our profitability to decline.



Our operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future, making it difficult to predict the timing and amount of revenues, costs and expenditures.



Our operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons, particularly as we focus on increasing doctor and consumer demand for our products.  Some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include:



•limited visibility into and difficulty predicting from quarter to quarter, the level of activity in our customers’ practices;

•changes in geographic, channel, or product mix;

•weakness in consumer spending as a result of a slowdown in the global, U.S. or other economies;

•higher manufacturing costs;

•competition in general and competitive developments in the market;

•changes in relationships with our dental support organizations and distributors, including timing of orders;

•changes in the timing of when revenues are recognized, including as a result of the timing of receipt of product orders and shipments, the introduction of new products and software releases, product offerings or promotions, modifications to our terms and conditions or as a result of new accounting pronouncements or changes to critical accounting estimates including, without limitation, those estimates based on such matters as our predicted usage of additional aligners;

•fluctuations in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar;

•our inability to scale, suspend or reduce production based on variations in product demand;

•increased participation in our customer rebate or discount programs could adversely affect our average selling prices;

•seasonal fluctuations, including those related to patient demographics such as teen buying habits in China and Europe as well as the number of doctors in their offices and their availability to take appointments;

•success of or changes to our marketing programs from quarter to quarter;

•our reliance on our contract manufacturers for the production of sub-assemblies for our intraoral scanners;

•increased advertising or marketing efforts or aggressive price competition from competitors;

•changes to our effective tax rate;

•unanticipated delays and disruptions in the manufacturing process caused by insufficient capacity or availability of raw materials, turnover in the labor force or the introduction of new production processes, power outages or natural or other disasters beyond our control;

•underutilization of manufacturing and treat facilities;

•major changes in available technology or the preferences of customers may cause our current product offerings to become less competitive or obsolete;

•costs and expenditures in connection with litigation;

•costs and expenditures in connection with the establishment of treatment planning and fabrication facilities in international locations;

•costs and expenditures in connection with hiring and deployment of direct sales force personnel;

•unanticipated delays in our receipt of patient records made through intraoral scanners for any reason;

•disruptions to our business due to political, economic or other social instability or any governmental regulatory or similar actions, including the impact of an epidemic such as recent developments beginning in China in connection with the Novel Coronavirus, any of which results in changes in consumer spending habits, consumers unable or unwilling to visit the orthodontist or general practitioners office, as well as any impact on workforce absenteeism;

•inaccurate forecasting of net revenues, production and other operating costs;

•investments in research and development to develop new products and enhancements;

•material impairments in the value of our privately held companies; and

•timing of industry tradeshows.












To respond to these and other factors, we may make business decisions that adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy, promotions, development efforts, product releases, business structure or operations. Most of our expenses, such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations, are relatively fixed in the short term. Moreover, our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding future revenue levels. As a result, if our net revenues for a particular period fall below expectations, we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any shortfall in net revenues. Due to these and other factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance.



A disruption in the operations of our primary freight carrier or higher shipping costs could cause a decline in our net revenues or a reduction in our earnings.



We are dependent on commercial freight carriers, primarily UPS, to deliver our products. If the operations of these carriers are disrupted for any reason, we may be unable to timely deliver our products to our customers. If we cannot deliver our products on time and cost effectively, our customers may choose competitive offerings or create their own aligners causing our net revenues and gross margins to decline, possibly materially. In a rising fuel cost environment, our freight costs will increase. In addition, we earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales. International sales carry higher shipping costs which could negatively impact our gross margin and results of operations. If freight costs materially increase and we are unable to pass that increase along to our customers for any reason or otherwise offset such increases in our cost of net revenues, our gross margin and financial results could be adversely affected.



If we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth and fail to hire a sufficient number of technicians in advance of such demand, or hire technicians faster than our actual growth projections, the delivery time of our products could be delayed or our costs may exceed our revenues, each of which could adversely affect our results of operations.



Treatment planning is a key step leading to our manufacturing process which relies on sophisticated computer software.  This requires new technicians to undergo a relatively long training process, often up to 120 days or longer. As a result, if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth, we may have an insufficient number of trained technicians to deliver our products within the time frame our customers expect. Such a delay could cause us to lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers. This could cause a decline in our net revenues and net income and could adversely affect our results of operations.  Conversely, if we hire and train technicians in anticipation of volume growth that does not materialize or materializes at a rate we do not anticipate, our costs and expenditures may outpace our revenue growth, harming our gross margins, operating expenses and financial results.



Our information technology systems are critical to our business. System integration and implementation issues and system security risks could disrupt our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results.



We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems. All information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources. As our business has grown in size and complexity, the growth has placed, and will continue to place significant demands on such systems. To effectively manage this growth, our information systems and applications require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences. We are continuing to transform certain business processes, extend established processes to new subsidiaries and/or implement additional functionality in our enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) software system which entails certain risks, including difficulties with changes in business processes that could disrupt our operations, such as our ability to track orders and timely ship products, manage our supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data.



System upgrades and enhancements require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable employee resources. Delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.



Additionally, we continuously upgrade our customer facing software applications, specifically the ClinCheck software, MyAligntech and the Invisalign Doctor Site. Software applications frequently contain errors or defects, especially when they are first introduced or when new versions are released. The discovery of a defect or error in our software applications or information systems, or incompatibility with customers’ computer operating systems and hardware configurations with a new release or upgraded version or the failure of our primary information systems may result in the following consequences, among others: delay or loss of revenues or delay in market acceptance, damage to our reputation, loss of market share to competition or increased service costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.



If the information we rely on to run our businesses were to be found to be inaccurate or unreliable, if we fail to properly maintain our information systems and data integrity, or if we fail to develop new capabilities to meet our business needs in a timely










manner, we could suffer operational disruptions, have customer disputes, fail to produce timely and accurate reports, have regulatory or other legal problems, experience increases in operating and administrative expenses, lose existing customers, have difficulty in attracting new customers or in implementing our growth strategies, or suffer other adverse consequences. In addition, experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security or our cloud-based software servers hosted by third parties and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Furthermore, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we either internally develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design and manufacture, including “bugs” and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. The costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems, viruses and bugs could be significant, and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions that may have a material adverse impact on our operations, net revenues and operating results.



Furthermore, our business requires the secure transmission of confidential patient health information over public networks. Because we store and transmit sensitive information including protected patient health information, security breaches could expose us to a risk of regulatory action, litigation, possible liability and loss. We have experienced breaches in the past and our security measures may be inadequate to prevent future security breaches, and our business operations and profitability would be adversely affected by, among other things, loss of customers and potential criminal and civil sanctions if they are not prevented.



There can be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems, developing new systems to support our expanding operations, integrating new systems, protecting confidential patient health information, and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future. Failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.



If the security of our customer and patient information is compromised or we are unable to comply with data protection laws, patient care could suffer, and we could be liable for related damages, and our reputation could be impaired.





We are also subject to federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, including ones relating to privacy, data protection, content regulation, and consumer protection. We may be or become subject to data localization or data residency laws which generally require that certain types of data collected within a country be stored and processed only within that country or approved countries.  Some countries, including Russia and China, have enacted, and others are considering enacting, data localization or data residency laws.  If countries in which we have customers adopt data localization or data residency laws, we could be required to implement new or expand existing data storage protocols, build new storage facilities, and/or devote additional resources to comply with the requirements of such laws, any of which could have significant cost implications. We may also be subject to data export restrictions, or international transfer laws which prohibit or impose conditions upon the transfer of such data from one country to another.  These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created or amended in a manner that could adversely affect our business.



In addition, we must comply with numerous data protection requirements that span from individual state and national laws in the U.S. to multinational requirements in the EU. In the EU, we must comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) which serves as a harmonization of European data-privacy laws. We believe we have designed our product and service offerings to be compliant with the requirements of applicable data protection laws and regulations. Maintaining systems that are compliant with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do business or provide services to our customers and their patients. Additionally, our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare providers in managing data protection requirements.












In order to deepen our market penetration and raise awareness of our brand and products, we have increased the amount we spend on marketing activities, which may not ultimately prove successful or an effective use of our resources.



To increase awareness of our products and services domestically and internationally, we have increased the amount we spend, and anticipate spending in the future on marketing activities. Our marketing efforts and costs are significant and include national and regional campaigns involving television, print media, social media and, more recently, alliances with professional sports teams and other strategic partners. We attempt to structure our advertising campaigns in ways we believe most likely to increase brand awareness and adoption; however, there is no assurance our campaigns will achieve the returns on advertising spend desired or successfully increase brand or product awareness sufficiently to sustain or increase our growth goals, which could have an adverse effect on our gross margin and business overall.



Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology, and if we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position may be harmed. Litigating claims of this type is costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price.



Our success depends in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property rights and to obtain and maintain further intellectual property protection for our products, both in the U.S. and in other countries. Our inability to do so could harm our competitive position.For further details concerning our patents and other intellectual property, please see “Intellectual Property” in Part I, Item 1. Business” of this annual report on Form 10-K.





Litigation, interferences, oppositions, re-exams, inter partes reviews, post grant reviews or other proceedings are, have been and may in the future be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights, and in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. Litigation, interference, oppositions, re-exams, inter partes reviews, post grant reviews, administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are unpredictable and may be protracted, expensive and distracting to management. The outcome of such proceedings could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights, hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products, require us to seek a license for the infringed product or technology or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages. An unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or, in cases where injunctive relief is sought, an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products. Any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price.



Obtaining approvals and complying with regulations enforced by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities is an expensive and time-consuming process, and any failure to obtain or maintain approvals for our products or services or failure to comply with regulations could materially harm our sales, result in substantial penalties and cause harm to our reputation.



Our products are considered medical devices and are subject to extensive and widely varying regulations in the U.S. and internationally. Before we can sell a new medical device in the U.S., or market a new use of or claim for an existing product, we must obtain FDA clearance or approval unless an exemption applies. Internationally, similar requirements apply on a country by country basis.  In the U.S., FDA regulations are wide ranging and govern, among other things:



•product design, development, manufacturing and testing;










•product labeling;

•product storage;

•pre-market clearance or approval;

•complaint handling and corrective actions;

•advertising and promotion; and

•product sales and distribution.



It takes significant time, effort and expense to obtain and maintain FDA approvals of our products and services.  In other countries, the requirements to obtain and maintain similar approvals may differ materially from those of the FDA.  Moreover, there is no guarantee we will successfully obtain or maintain approvals in all or any of the countries in which we do business now or in the future.  Even if we are successful, the time and effort may take significantly longer, and costs may be significantly greater.  If approvals to market our products or services are delayed, whether in the U.S. or other countries, we may be unable to market our products or services in markets we deem important to our business.  Were any of these risks to occur, our domestic or international operations may be materially harmed, and our business as a whole adversely impacted.



In addition, our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement actions in the U.S. and other countries. For example, enforcement actions by the FDA may include any of the following sanctions:



•warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;

•repair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our products;

•operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;

•refusing our requests for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new products, new intended uses, or modifications to existing products;

•withdrawing clearance or pre-market approvals that have already been granted; and

•criminal prosecution.



We must also comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the FDA and adhere to applicable Quality System regulations. The FDA enforces its Quality System regulations through periodic unannounced inspections. Our failure to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection or the failure to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could result in enforcement action, and we may be required to find alternative manufacturers, which could be a long and costly process. Any enforcement action by the FDA or foreign governments could have a material adverse effect on us.



The sourcing and availability of metals used in the manufacture of a limited number of parts (if any) contained in our products may be affected by laws and regulations in the U.S. or internationally regarding the use of minerals obtained from certain regions of the world like the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. These laws and regulations may decrease the number of suppliers capable of supplying our needs for certain metals, thereby negatively affecting our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. We may furthermore suffer financial and reputational harm if customers require, and we are unable to deliver, certification that our products are conflict free. Regardless, we will incur additional costs associated with compliance with these laws and regulations, including time-consuming and costly efforts to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products.



We are required to annually assess our internal control over financial reporting and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price.












of our financial reports in the future, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.

If we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel, we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products.



We are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering, technology development, sales, training and marketing personnel and management teams. The loss of the services provided by those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business. Our future success will also depend on our ability to identify, recruit, train and retain additional qualified personnel, including orthodontists and production technicians in our treatment planning facilities. Few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices, universities and other research institutions. Thus, we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business. Furthermore, we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business could be materially harmed.



If we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim, our ability to grow our business may be severely limited.



Extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry. We have been sued for infringement of third party’s patents in the past and we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future. We periodically receive and may in the future receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights. While we do not believe we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention, there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits, interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel. An adverse determination of any litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities. An adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties. Licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, in which event, our business would be materially adversely affected.



We maintain single supply relationships for certain key machines and materials, and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases.





We depend on a single contract manufacturer and supplier of parts used in our iTero scanner and any disruption in this relationship may cause us to fail to meet the demands of our customers and damage our customer relationships.



We rely on a third-party manufacturer to supply key sub-assemblies for our iTero Element scanner. As a result, if this manufacturer fails to deliver its components, if we lose its services or if we fail to negotiate or maintain acceptable terms, we may be unable to deliver our products in a timely manner and our business may be harmed. Furthermore, any difficulties encountered by this manufacturer with respect to hiring personnel and maintaining acceptable manufacturing standards, controls, procedures and policies could disrupt our ability to timely deliver our products. Finding a substitute manufacturer may be expensive, time-consuming or impossible and could result in a significant interruption in the supply of our intraoral scanning products. Any failure by our contract manufacturer that results in delays in our fulfillment of customer orders may cause us to lose revenues and suffer damage to our customer relationships.












We primarily rely on our direct sales force to sell our products, and any failure to train and maintain our direct sales force could harm our business.





As compliance with healthcare regulations becomes more costly and difficult for us or our customers, we may be unable to grow our business.



Participants in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous laws administered by governmental entities at the federal, state and local levels, some of which are, and others of which may be, applicable to our business.



Furthermore, our healthcare provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us. The healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences. Regulations implemented pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), including regulations affecting the security and privacy of patient healthcare information held by healthcare providers and their business associates may require us to make significant and unplanned enhancements of software applications or services, result in delays or cancellations of orders, or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants. The effect of HIPAA and newly enforced regulations on our business is difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks created by HIPAA and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities.



Extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties.



In addition to medical device laws and regulations, numerous state and federal healthcare-related laws regulate our business, covering areas such as:



•storage, transmission and disclosure of medical information and healthcare records;

•prohibitions against the offer, payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals to entities providing healthcare services or goods or to induce the order, purchase or recommendation of our products; and

•the marketing and advertising of our products.



Complying with these laws and regulations could be expensive and time-consuming and could increase our operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our sales and marketing activities or our revenues.



Our business exposes us to potential product liability claims, and we may incur substantial expenses if we are subject to product liability claims or litigation.



Medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity. We may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found unhealthy or unsuitable. Although we intend to continue to maintain product liability insurance, adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. A product liability claim, regardless of its merit or eventual outcome, could result in significant legal defense costs and damage our reputation. These costs would have the effect of increasing our expenses and diverting management’s attention away from the operation of our business and could harm our business.












Business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.





Changes in, or interpretations of, accounting rules and regulations, could result in unfavorable accounting charges.



We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S. ("GAAP"). These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies. A change in these policies or in the way these policies are interpreted by us or regulators can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions.



If we fail to manage our exposure to global financial and securities market risk successfully, our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted.



The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal. To achieve this objective, a majority of our marketable investments are investment grade, liquid, fixed-income securities and money market instruments denominated in U.S. dollars. If the carrying value of our investments exceeds the fair value, and the decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we will be required to write down the value of our investments, which could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, the performance of certain securities in our investment portfolio correlates with the credit condition of the U.S. financial sector. In an unstable credit environment, we might incur significant realized, unrealized or impairment losses associated with these investments.



If our goodwill or long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.



Under GAAP, we review our goodwill and long-lived asset group for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Additionally, goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. The qualitative and quantitative analysis used to test goodwill are dependent upon various assumptions and reflect management’s best estimates. Changes in certain assumptions including revenue growth rates, discount rates, earnings multiples and future cash flows may cause a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of goodwill or the asset group may be impaired. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of goodwill or asset group are determined.



We may experience unexpected issues and expenses associated with our corporate structure reorganization, including the relocation of our EMEA regional headquarters to Switzerland.



We reorganized our corporate structure and intercompany relationships in January 2020 in an effort to more closely align our international business activities and to achieve financial and operational efficiencies. The implementation of this reorganization plan included the move of our EMEA regional headquarters from the Netherlands to Switzerland, has been time-consuming and costly, may be disruptive to our business, and, following completion of the reorganization plan, may not be more efficient or effective. This relocation is accompanied by a number of risks and uncertainties that may affect our results of operations and statement of cash flows, including:












•failure to retain key employees who possess specific knowledge or expertise and upon whom we are depending upon for the timely and successful transition;

•difficulties in hiring employees in Switzerland with the necessary skills and expertise; and

•increased costs as we transition the operations to Switzerland along with higher costs of doing business in Switzerland.



If any of these risks materialize in the future, our operating results, statement of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.



Our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period.



Various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in legal entity structure and/or activities performed within our entities, changes in tax laws, regulations and/or rates, new or changes to accounting pronouncements, changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates, changes in overall levels of pretax earnings, the future levels of tax benefits of stock-based compensation, settlement of income tax audits and non-deductible goodwill impairments. For example, our effective tax rate will vary significantly in our first quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the relocation of our EMEA regional headquarters from the Netherlands to Switzerland effective January 1, 2020. Also, we may continue to experience significant variation in our effective tax rate related to excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation, particularly in the first quarter of each year when the majority of our equity awards vest.



Changes in tax laws or tax rulings could negatively impact our income tax provision and net income.



As a U.S. multinational corporation, we are subject to changing tax laws both within and outside of the U.S. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing tax laws, could affect our income tax provision and net income or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. In addition, governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies. Many countries in Europe, as well as a number of other countries and organizations, have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws. For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) has been working on a “Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project,” which is focused on a number of issues, including the shifting of profits between affiliated entities in different tax jurisdictions. The OECD has issued and is expected to continue to issue, guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business.



We are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments. Impairments in the value of our investments and unsecured promissory note could negatively impact our financial results.



We have invested in privately held companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives, and we may not realize a return on our strategic investments. Many of such companies generate net losses and the market for their products, services or technologies may be slow to develop. Further, valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data. If we determine that our investments have experienced a decline in value or are determined to be uncollectible, we may be required to record impairments which could be material and could have an adverse impact on our financial results.



Risks Related to our Common Stock



Historically, the market price for our common stock has been volatile.



The market price of our common stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. The factors include:



•quarterly variations in our results of operations and liquidity or changes in our forecasts and guidance;

•changes in recommendations by the investment community or in their estimates of our net revenues or operating results;

•speculation in the press or investment community concerning our business and results of operations;

•announcements by competitors or new market entrants;

•strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as management changes, material transactions or acquisitions;

•announcements regarding stock repurchases, sales of our common stock, credit agreements and debt issuances;

•announcements of technological innovations or new products or product offerings by us, our customers or competitors;

•key decisions in pending litigation

•sales of stock by us, our officers or directors; and

•general economic market conditions.












In addition, the stock market, in general, and the market for technology and medical device companies, in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Historically, class action litigation is often brought against an issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities and we have not been excepted from such litigation.



We cannot guarantee we will continue to repurchase our common stock, and any repurchases may not achieve our objectives.



We have a history of recurring stock repurchase programs intended to return capital to our investors. Any authorization or continuance of our share repurchase programs is contingent on a variety of factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, business requirements, and our board of directors' continuing determination that share repurchases are in the best interests of our stockholders and in compliance with all applicable laws and agreements. There is no assurance that we will continue to repurchase stock consistent with historical levels or at all, or that our stock repurchase programs will have a beneficial impact on our stock price.



Future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price.



A large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders. These stockholders have sold in the past, and may sell in the future, large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Such sales could create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business and may depress our stock price.
