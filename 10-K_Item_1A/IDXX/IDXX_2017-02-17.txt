ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS



Our future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this report. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below, as well as those factors discussed elsewhere in this report.



Our Business Lines are Highly Competitive and Our Failure to Successfully Execute Certain Strategies Could Have a Material Negative Impact on Our Growth and Profitability



The companion animal healthcare industry is highly competitive and we anticipate increasing levels of competition from both existing competitors and new market entrants. Our ability to maintain or enhance our growth rates and our profitability depends on our successful execution of many elements of our strategy, including:



·Developing, manufacturing and marketing innovative new or improved and cost competitive in-clinic laboratory analyzersthat drive sales of IDEXX VetLab instruments, grow our installed base of instruments and increase demand for related recurring sales of consumable products, services and accessories;



·Developing and introducing new proprietary diagnostic tests and services that provide valuable medical information to our customers and effectively differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors;



·Increasing the value to our customers of our companion animal products and services by enhancing the integration of the information and transactions of these products and the management of diagnostic information derived from our products;



·Providing our veterinary customers with the medical and business tools, information and resources that enable them to grow their practices through increased pet visits and enhanced practice of real-time care;



·Achieving cost improvements in our worldwide network of reference laboratories by implementing global best practices, including lean processing techniques, incorporating technological enhancements, including laboratory automation and a global laboratory information management system, employing purchasing strategies to maximize leverage of our global scale, increasing the leverage of existing infrastructure and consolidating testing in high volume laboratory hubs;

﻿

·Achieving cost improvements in the manufacture and service of our in-clinic laboratory analyzers by employing the benefits of economies of scale in both negotiating supply contracts and leveraging manufacturing overhead, and by improving reliability of our instruments;

﻿

·Continuing to expand, develop and advance the productivity of our companion animal diagnostic sales, marketing, customer support and logistics organizations in the U.S. in support of, among other things, our all-direct sales strategy for our rapid assay kits and instrument consumables (“kits and consumables”) in the U.S.;

﻿

·Attracting, developing and retaining key leadership and talent necessary to support all elements of our strategy;

﻿

·Expanding our served market and growing our market share by strengthening our sales and marketing activities both within the U.S. and in geographies outside of the U.S.;

﻿

·Identifying, completing and integrating acquisitions that enhance our existing businesses or create new business or geographic areas for us; and

﻿

·Developing and implementing new technology and licensing strategies.














If we are unsuccessful in implementing and executing on some or all of these strategies, our rate of growth or profitability may be negatively impacted.

﻿

Our Dependence on Suppliers Could Limit Our Ability to Sell Certain Products or Negatively Affect Our Operating Results



We rely on third-party suppliers to provide components in our products, manufacture products that we do not manufacture ourselves and perform services that we do not provide ourselves, including package-delivery services. Because these suppliers are independent third parties with their own financial objectives, actions taken by them could have a materially negative effect on our results of operations. The risks of relying on suppliers include our inability to enter into contracts with third-party suppliers on reasonable terms, inconsistent or inadequate quality control, relocation of supplier facilities, supplier work stoppages and suppliers’ failure to comply with applicable regulations or their contractual obligations. Problems with suppliers could materially negatively impact our ability to supply the market, substantially decrease sales, lead to higher costs or damage our reputation with our customers.

﻿

In addition, we currently purchase many products and materials from sole or single sources. Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and, therefore, cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources. These products include the majority of our Catalyst Dx and Catalyst One consumables; VetLyte electrolyte consumables, ProCyte Dx hematology, IDEXX VetAutoread hematology, VetTest chemistry analyzers and related consumables and accessories; SediVue Dx urine sediment analyzer; image capture plates used in our diagnostic imaging systems; and certain components and raw materials used in our SNAP



rapid assay kits and SNAP Pro Mobile Device, Catalyst One, LaserCyte



and

LaserCyte Dx hematology analyzer

s, livestock and poultry diagnostic tests, dairy testing products, and water testing products. To mitigate risks associated with sole and single source suppliers, we seek when possible to enter into long-term contracts that provide for an uninterrupted supply of products at predictable prices. However, some suppliers decline to enter into long-term contracts and we are required to purchase products with short term contracts or on a purchase order basis. There can be no assurance that suppliers with which we do not have contracts will continue to supply our requirements for products, that suppliers with which we do have contracts will always fulfill their obligations under these contracts, or that any of our suppliers will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply our requirements for products. In cases where we purchase sole and single source products or components under purchase orders, we are more susceptible to unanticipated cost increases or changes in other terms of supply. In addition, under some contracts with suppliers we have minimum purchase obligations, and our failure to satisfy those obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these contracts or require us to compensate the supplier. If we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of products in the future from sole and single source suppliers, we may be unable to supply the market, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.



﻿

Our Biologic Products Are Complex and Difficult to Manufacture, Which CouldNegativelyAffect Our Ability to Supply the Market



Many of our rapid assay, livestock and poultry diagnostic, water and dairy products are biologic products, which are products that include materials from living organisms, such as antibodies, cells and sera. Manufacturing biologic products is highly complex due to the inherent variability of biological input materials and to the difficulty of controlling the interactions of these materials with other components of the products, samples and the environment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that we will be able to consistently manufacture biologic products that satisfy applicable product release criteria. Further, products that meet release criteria at the time of manufacture may fall out of specification while in customer inventory, which could require us to incur expenses associated with recalling products and providing customers with new products, and could damage customer relations. Our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could result in our inability to supply the market with these products and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

﻿














Increased Competition and Technological Advances by Our Competitors Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results

﻿

﻿

﻿

Various Government Regulations Could Limit or Delay Our Ability to Market and Sell Our Products or Otherwise Negatively Impact Our Business



In the U.S., the manufacture and sale of certain of our products are regulated by agencies such as the USDA, the FDA or the EPA. Our diagnostic tests for animal health applications that involve the detection of infectious diseases, including most rapid assay canine and feline SNAP tests and livestock and poultry diagnostic tests, must be approved by the USDA prior to sale in the U.S. Our dairy testing products require approval by the FDA prior to sale in the U.S. Our water testing products must be approved by the EPA before they can be used by customers in the U.S. as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the EPA. The manufacture and sale of ourOPTIline of human point-of-care electrolytes and blood gas analyzers require approval by the FDA before they may be sold commercially in the U.S. In addition, delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability.

﻿

The manufacture and sale of our products, as well as our research and development processes, are subject to similar and sometimes more stringent laws in many foreign countries. For example, the European Union regulates the use of certain substances that we currently use in our products or processes. These regulations include the Biocidal Products Regulation, whichmay requireapproval forthe use ofcertainbiocides in our productsprior to being used or sold in the European Union, and the European Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization










and Restriction of Chemical Substances, or REACH, which regulates and restricts the use of certain chemicals in the European Union.Compliance with these regulations (and similar regulations that may be adopted elsewhere) may require registration of the applicable substances or the redesign or reformulation of our products and may reduce or eliminate the availability of certain parts and components used in our products and services in the event our suppliers are unable to comply with the applicable regulations in a timely and cost-effective manner. Any redesign or reformulation or restricted supply of parts and components may negatively affect the availability or performance of our products and services, add testing lead-times for products and reformulated products, reduce our margins, result in additional costs or have other similar effects. In addition, the costs to comply with these regulations may be significant. Any of these could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.These legal and regulatory requirements are complex and subject to change, and we continue to evaluate their impact.

﻿

We are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the importation and exportation of products; our business practices in the U.S. and abroad, such as anti-corruption and anti-competition laws; and immigration and travel restrictions. These legal and regulatory requirements differ among jurisdictions around the world and are rapidly changing and increasingly complex. The costs associated with compliance with these legal and regulatory requirements are significant and likely to increase in the future.

﻿

Any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements could result in fines, penalties and sanctions; product recalls; suspensions or discontinuations of, or limitations or restrictions on, our ability to design, manufacture, market, import, export or sell our products; and damage to our reputation.

﻿

Consolidation in Our Customer Base, Including Through Increased Corporate Hospital Ownership, and Prevalence of Buying Consortiums Could Negatively Affect Our Business



﻿

Our Success Is Heavily Dependent Upon Proprietary Technologies



We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights. We also license patents and technologies from third parties to enable the use of third-party technologies in the development and production of our products and offerings. If we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights or are unable to license third-party patents and technologies on reasonable terms, our business may be affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us.














We cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents, that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid, or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies. Even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors, the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial, and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights.



In the past, we have received notices claiming that our products infringe third-party patents and we may receive such notices in the future. Patent litigation is complex and expensive, and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict. We cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case. If we lose, we may be prohibited from selling certain products and/or we may be required to pay damages and/or ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit. Any such result could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

﻿

Changes in Testing Patterns Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results



﻿

Our Operations and Reputation May Be Impaired if We, Our Products or Our Services Do Not Comply with Evolving Laws and Regulations Regarding Data Privacy and Protection

We offer products and services thatcollectand usedata provided by client practicesandindividuals, including practice management systems for veterinary practices (e.g., Cornerstoneand Neo), online client communication tools and services (e.g., Pet Health Network Pro), and cloud-based technology through VetConnect PLUS that enables veterinarians to access and analyze patients’ diagnostic data from IDEXX in-clinic analyzers, our Rapid Assays and Reference Laboratories in one place. Some of these products and services rely on third-party providers for cloud storage. We also engage in e-commerce through various IDEXX websites and collect contact and other personally identifiable information from our customers and visitors to our websites.

Federal, state and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of personally identifiable information, including data that we receive from our employees, customers, vendors and visitors to our websites and data collected by our customers and others when using our products and services. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries, and among us, our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions, including requiring local storage and processing of data. These laws and regulations continue to develop, are subject to differing interpretations and may be applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may be inconsistent with our current data protection and privacy policies and practices.














For example, on October 6, 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union decided that the EU-U.S. Safe Harbor framework that had been in place since 2000, which allowed transfers of personal data to the U.S. in compliance with applicable EU data protection laws, was invalid.On February 2, 2016, U.S. and European Commission officials announced they had agreed upon a framework for a new data sharing agreement, called the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, to replace the EU-U.S. Safe Harbor framework.The European Commission and the U.S. Department of Commerce issued the final text for the Privacy Shield framework in July 2016, and it became operational whentheU.S. Department of Commerce began accepting applications for Privacy Shield certification on August 1, 2016.We submitted our self-certification under the Privacy Shield in September 2016and adopted this framework totransfer personal data to the U.S. in compliance with EU data protection laws.Effective as of January 10, 2017, the U.S. Department of Commerce completed its review of our self-certification, and we joined the Privacy Shield list of participating organizations.

Additionally, in April 2016, the EU Parliament adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which, among other things, imposes more stringent data protection requirements and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance and is expected to take effect in 2018. The costs associated with compliance with these evolving legal and regulatory requirements are significant and likely to increase in the future and as a result may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. In addition, we have and post on our website our own privacy policy concerning the collection, use and disclosure of user data. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us or our products and services to protect employee or customer data (including as a result of a breach by or of a third-party provider) or to comply with any privacy-related laws, government regulations or directives or industry self-regulatory principles or our posted privacy policies could result in damage to our reputation or proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or otherwise, which could have an adverse effect on our business.

﻿

Strengthening of the Rate of Exchange for the U.S. Dollar Has a Negative Effect on Our Business



We are a global business, with 39 percent of our revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016, attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside of the U.S. Any strengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, and in particular the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, Australian dollar and Brazilian real, adversely affects our results, as it reduces the dollar value of sales and profits that are made in those currencies. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar has a greater adverse effect on the profits from products manufactured or sourced in U.S. dollars that are exported to international markets and a lesser effect on profits from foreign sourced products and services due to a natural hedge from international expenses denominated in the corresponding foreign currencies.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 21 percent of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured or sourced in U.S. dollars and sold internationally in local currencies, as compared to 20 percent and 22 percent for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

A strengthening U.S. dollar could also negatively impact the ability of customers outside the U.S. to pay for purchases denominated in U.S. dollars as well as affect our overall competitiveness in international markets. The accumulated impacts from any continued, longer-term growth in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies may have a material adverse effect on our operating results. See “Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding currency impact.

﻿

Our foreign currency hedging activities (see Note 17 — Hedging Instruments in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements), which are designed to minimize and delay, but not to eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, may not sufficiently offset the adverse financial effect of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates on our financial results over the limited time the hedges are in place. In addition, our hedging activities involve costs and risks, such as transactions costs and the risk that our hedging counterparties will default on their obligations.

﻿

We primarily hedge intercompany product purchases and sales denominated in the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, Australian dollar and Swiss franc. Other foreign currency exposures related to foreign sourced services and emerging markets may not be practical to hedge. In certain cases, these exposures are not offset by foreign currency denominated costs. As we primarily use foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months and enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions on a quarterly basis for the current and following year, the effectiveness of our foreign currency hedging activities to offset longer-term appreciation in the value of the U.S. dollar against non-U.S.










currencies may be limited. Factors that could affect the effectiveness of our hedging activities include accuracy of sales and other forecasts, volatility of currency markets, and the cost and availability of hedging instruments. Since the hedging activities are designed to minimize volatility, they not only temporarily reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, but they also temporarily reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. Our future financial results could be significantly affected by a strengthening value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities.

﻿

A Weak Worldwide Economy Could Result in Reduced Demand for Our Products and Services or Increased Customer Credit Risk



A substantial percentage of our sales are made worldwide to the companion animal veterinary market. Demand for our companion animal diagnostic products and services is driven in part by the number of patient visits to veterinary hospitals and the practices of veterinarians with respect to the recommendations for diagnostic testing, as well as pet owner compliance with these recommendations. Economic weakness in our significant markets could cause pet owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary hospitals or affect their willingness to approve certain diagnostic tests, comply with a treatment plan or, even more fundamentally, continue to own a pet. In addition, concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be less likely to recommend certain diagnostic tests, and concerns about the economy may cause veterinarians to defer purchasing capital items such as our instruments and systems. These conditions, if they continue, could result in a decrease in sales or decrease in sales growth, of diagnostic products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.



Demand for our water products is driven in part by the availability of funds at government laboratories, water utilities and private certified laboratories that utilize our products. Availability of funds also affects demand by government laboratories and cattle, swine and poultry producers that utilize our livestock and poultry diagnostic products, and by users of our human point-of-care diagnostic instruments. Economic weakness in our markets has caused and could continue to cause our customers to reduce their investment in such testing, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.



In all of our markets, a weak economy may also cause deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors and customers, which could inhibit their ability to pay us amounts owed for products delivered or services provided in a timely fashion or at all.

﻿

Risks Associated with Doing Business Internationally Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results

﻿

For the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 39 percentof ourrevenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the U.S., compared to 39 percent for the year ended December 31, 2015, and 43 percent for the year ended December 31, 2014. Although we intend to continue to expand our international operations and business, we may not be able to successfully promote, market, import, export, sell or distribute our products and services outside the U.S. Various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales, including disruptions in transportation of our products, fluctuations in oil prices, increased border protection and restriction on travel, the differing product and service needs of foreign customers, difficulties in building and managing foreign operations, import/export restrictions, duties and licensing requirements, natural disasters, unexpected regulatory and economic or political changes in foreign markets, security concerns and local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices prohibited by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations.

﻿

Further, prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the U.S. due to competitive, market or other factors, or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, foreign government regulations may restrict our ability to repatriate funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions, and any repatriation of such funds to the U.S. may result in higher effective tax rates for us. Our results of operations are also susceptible to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As a result, the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have an adverse impact on our results of operations for that period.

﻿














Our Business Sells Many Products through Distributors, which Present Risks that Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results

﻿

﻿

Our Limited Experience and Small Scale in the Human Point-of-Care Market Could Inhibit Our Success in this Market



We have limited experience in the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market and we operate at a small scale in this market. This market differs in many respects from the veterinary diagnostic market. Significant differences include the impact of third-party reimbursement on diagnostic testing, more extensive regulation, greater product liability risks, larger competitors, a more segmented customer base and more rapid technological innovation. Our limited experience and small scale in the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and features of this market that differ from the veterinary diagnostic market. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary diagnostic market.

﻿

Our Operations are Vulnerable to Interruption as a Result of Natural and Man-Made Disasters, System Disruptions and Security Breaches, and Disruptions, Attacks or Breaches of Information Systems Could Adversely Affect Our Business



The operation of all of our facilities, as well as those of our third party business partners on which we rely, may be vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural and man-made disasters, interruptions in power supply or other system failures. While we maintain plans to continue business under such circumstances, there can be no assurance that such plans will be successful in fully or partially mitigating the effects of such events.



We manufacture many of our significant companion animal products, including our rapid assay devices and certain instruments, many of our water testing products and certain of our livestock, poultry and dairy testing products, at a single facility in Westbrook, Maine. Certain of our companion animal products, as well as our human point-of-care products, are manufactured in Roswell, Georgia. We also manufacture certain of our livestock and poultry testing products in Bern, Switzerland and Montpellier, France. In addition, we maintain major distribution facilities in North America and in the Netherlands and major reference laboratories in Memphis, Tennessee; Leipzig, Germany; Ludwigsburg, Germany; Sacramento, California; Elmhurst, Illinois; North Grafton, Massachusetts; East Brisbane, Australia; Markham, Ontario; Wetherby, U.K.; and Tokyo, Japan. Interruption of operations at any of these facilities could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.



We rely on several information systems throughout our company, as well as our business partners’ information systems, to keep financial records, analyze results of operations, process customer orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers, store confidential or proprietary information and operate other critical functions. Although we employ system backup measures, our current disaster recovery plan may be ineffective or inadequate to address all eventualities.Further, our information systems and our business partners’ information systems may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers and other security breaches, including computer viruses, through the Internet (including via devices and applications connected to the Internet), email attachments and persons with










access to these information systems. We process credit card payments electronically over secure networks. Any such attack or breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. While we have implemented network security and internal control measures and invested in our data and information technology infrastructure, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent a system disruption, attack or security breach. In addition, we offer products and services that connect to and are part of the “Internet of Things,” such as our connected devices (e.g., IDEXX VetLab instruments). While we have implemented security measures to protect our connected products and services from cyberattacks, the risk of system disruptions and security breaches from a cyberattack remains.

﻿

Ifwe or our business partners were to experience a system disruption, attack or security breach that impacts any of our critical functions, or our customers were to experience a system disruption, attack or security breach via any of our connected products and services, it could result in a period of shutdown of information systems during which we (or our customers) may not be able to operate, the loss of sales and customers, financial misstatement, potential liability for damages to our customers, reputational damage and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business.Furthermore, any access to, public disclosure of, or other loss of information (including any of our confidential or proprietary information) as a result of an attack or security breach could result in governmental actions or private claims or proceedings, which could damage our reputation, cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, damage our ability to develop (and protect our rights to) our proprietary technologies and adversely affect our business.



We maintain property and business interruption insurance to insure against the financial impact of certain events of this nature. However, this insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for the full amount of any losses that we may incur. In addition, such insurance will not compensate us for the long-term competitive effects of being out of the market for the period of any interruption in operations.

﻿

Risks Associated with Fluctuations in the Market Values of our Investment Portfolio

﻿

Weinvest our surplus cash in a diversified portfolio of marketable securities, includingcorporate bonds, commercial paper,and a short-term money market fund which invests insecurities issued or sponsored by the U.S. government.The value and liquidity of these marketable securities may fluctuate substantially, and could be negatively affected by increases in interest rates, downgrades of the bonds and other securities included in our portfolio, instability in the global financial markets, declines in the value of collateral underlying the securities included in our portfolio, geopolitical events or other factors. Any adverse changes in the financial markets and resulting declines in the value of our portfolio could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.

﻿

If Our Quarterly or Annual Results of Operations Fluctuate, This Fluctuation May Cause Our Stock Price to Decline



Our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors, including seasonality of certain product lines; changes in our accounting estimates; the impact of acquisitions; timing of distributor purchases, product launches, operating expenditures, customer marketing and incentive programs, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, timing of regulatory approvals and licenses, litigation and claim-related expenditures; increase in the number and type of competitors; changes in competitors’ product offerings; changes in our sales and distribution model; changes in the economy affecting consumer spending; and other matters. Similarly, our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to these and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods, our stock price may fall.

﻿














Future Operating Results Could Be Negatively Affected by Changes in Tax Rates, the Adoption of New U.S. or International Tax Legislation or Exposure to Additional Tax Liabilities



We are subject to local, state, regional and federal tax laws in the U.S. and many other international jurisdictions.  Due to economic and political conditions, the various tax rates applied to the earnings of our activities are subject to significant change.  Our future tax expense could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.  Also, we have received tax rulings from various governments that have jurisdictional authority over our operations.  If we are unable to meet the requirements of such agreements, or if they expire or are renewed on less favorable terms, the result could negatively impact our future earnings.  Additionally, the European Commission has opened formal investigations into specific tax rulings granted by several countries to specific taxpayers.  While we believe that our rulings in the Netherlands and Switzerland are different than those being discussed, the ultimate resolution of such activities cannot be predicted and could also have an adverse impact on future operating results. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.

﻿

Our income tax filings are regularly under audit by various tax authorities, and the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. We regularly assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. Any reduction in these contingent liabilities or additional assessments would increase or decrease income, respectively, in the period such determination is made.

﻿

Restrictions in OurDebt Agreementsor Our Inability to Obtain Financing on Favorable Terms May Limit Our Activities

﻿

Our ability to make scheduled payments and satisfy our other obligations under our unsecured revolving credit facility and senior notes depends on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may notgenerate sufficient cash flows to meet these obligations or generate sufficient levels of earnings to satisfy the applicableaffirmative, negative and financial covenants. Our failure to comply with these covenants and the other terms of the credit facility and senior notes could result in anevent of default and acceleration of our obligations under these agreements, which may require us to seek additional financing or restructure existing debt on unfavorable terms. In addition, adverse changes in credit markets could increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing.

﻿

Our senior notes include provisions which stipulate a prepayment penalty for which we will be obligated in the event that we elect to repay the notes prior to their stated maturity dates. Should we elect to repay some or all of the outstanding principal balance on our senior notes, the prepayment penalty we incur could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.



We fund our operations, capital purchase requirements and strategic growth needs through cash on hand, funds generated from operations, amounts available under our credit facility and senior note financings. If we are unable to obtain financing on favorable terms, we could face restrictions that would limit our ability to execute certain strategies, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profitability.
