Item 1A.Risk Factors.

You should
carefully consider the specific risk factors set forth below and the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, as these are important factors, among others, that could cause our actual results to differ from our
expected or historical results. Some of the statements in this item and elsewhere in this Form 10-K are “forward-looking statements.” For a discussion of those statements and of other factors to consider see the “Cautionary Note
Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results” section below.



•General economic and business conditions may adversely impact consumer demand for vacations and, consequently, reduce our cruise brands’ net
revenue yields and profitability.

Demand for cruises is in part dependent on the underlying perceived or actual economic
condition of the countries from which cruise companies source their guests. Adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate, such as higher unemployment and underemployment rates; declines in income levels; securities, real estate and
other market declines and volatility; increasing taxation; higher fuel prices and healthcare costs; more restrictive credit markets; higher interest rates and changes in governmental regulations, could reduce our potential vacationers’
discretionary incomes, net worth or their consumer confidence. Consequently, this may negatively affect demand for vacations, including cruise vacations, which are a discretionary purchase. Decreases in demand could lead to price reductions
which, in turn, could reduce the profitability of our business. These ticket price reductions may result in a less affluent guest base, which along with decreases in discretionary income or consumer confidence could also result in lower onboard
revenues that could also have a negative effect on our net revenue yields and profitability.



•Increases in fuel prices may adversely affect our operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Economic, market and political conditions around the world such as fuel demand, regulatory requirements, supply disruptions and related infrastructure
needs, make it difficult to predict the future price and availability of fuel. Fuel costs accounted for 23%, 21% and 18% of our cruise operating expenses in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Future increases in the global price of fuel would
increase the cost of our cruise ship operations as well as some of our other expenses, such as crew travel, freight and commodity prices. We may be unable to implement additional fuel conservation initiatives and other best practices or increase
ticket prices and collect fuel supplements, which would help to fully or partially offset these fuel price increases. See risks relating to environmental laws and regulations, continuing financial viability of air service providers and failures to
keep pace with technology below for additional information regarding our fuel risks.







To mitigate a portion of our economic risk attributable to potential fuel price increases, we have
established a fuel derivatives program. To date under this program, we have bought Brent crude oil (“Brent”) call options and sold Brent put options, collectively referred to as zero cost collars, that established ceiling and floor prices.
These derivatives are based on Brent prices whereas the actual fuel used on our ships is marine fuel. Changes in the Brent prices may not show a high degree of correlation with changes in our underlying marine fuel prices. In addition, there can be
no assurance that our fuel derivatives program will provide a sufficient level of protection against increases in fuel prices or that our counterparties will be able to perform, such as in the case of a counterparty bankruptcy. The zero cost collars
will reduce our benefit if Brent prices drop below the floor. Also, the fuel derivative contracts may create significant volatility in our U.S. GAAP earnings due to volatility in fuel prices over the contracts’ terms. Furthermore, volatility in
fuel prices could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Finally, we believe that our
land-based vacation competitors’ operating costs are less affected by fuel price increases than cruise companies. Accordingly, fuel price increases may adversely impact cruise companies more than their land-based competitors.



•Incidents, the spread of contagious diseases and threats thereof, adverse weather conditions or other natural disasters and other incidents
affecting the health, safety, security and satisfaction of guests and crew could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability.

The operation of cruise ships, hotels, land tours, port facilities and shore excursions involve the risk of incidents, including those caused by the improper operation of our ships, motorcoaches and
trains; guest and crew illnesses, such as from the spread of contagious diseases; mechanical failures; fires and collisions; repair delays; groundings; navigational errors; oil spills and other maritime and environmental mishaps; missing passengers
and other incidents at sea or while in port or on land, which may cause injury and death, or the alteration of itineraries or cancellation of a cruise or series of cruises or tours. Although we place guest and crew safety as the highest priority in
all our operations, our ships have been involved in accidents and other incidents in the past. We may experience similar or other incidents in the future. These types of incidents may bring into question guest and crew health, safety, security and
satisfaction and may adversely affect our sales and profitability, may result in additional costs to our business, litigation against us and increasing government or other regulatory oversight.

In particular, our ability to effectively and efficiently operate shipboard and shoreside activities may be impacted by widespread public health
issues/illnesses or health warnings resulting in, among other things, reduced demand for cruises and cruise cancellations and employee absenteeism that could have an adverse affect on our sales and profitability. For example, a severe outbreak of
the influenza virus or some other pandemic could, among other things, disrupt our ability to embark/disembark passengers and crew, disrupt air travel to and from ports, increase costs for prevention and treatment and adversely affect our supply
chain. This could also adversely impact cruise demand in areas unaffected by such an outbreak.

In addition, as mentioned above, our ships are
subject to the risks of mechanical failures and accidents, for which we have had to incur repair expenses. If these occur in the future, we may be unable to procure spare parts when needed or make repairs without incurring significant expense or
suspension of service. A significant performance deficiency or problem on any one of our ships could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Our cruise ships, hotels, land tours, port facilities, shore excursions and other service providers may be impacted by adverse weather patterns or other natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes,
floods, fires, tornados, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. These events could result in, among other things, increased port related and other costs. It is possible that we could be forced to alter itineraries or cancel a cruise or a series of cruises
or tours due to these or other factors, which would have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability.

The frequency of extreme weather
events such as hurricanes and floods, which may be caused by climate change, may not only cause disruption, alteration, or cancellation of cruises but may also adversely impact commercial airline flights, other transport and shore excursion
activities or prevent our guests from electing to cruise altogether. Such extreme weather events may also disrupt the supply of provisions, fuel and shore power, and may limit our ability to safely embark and disembark our guests. In addition, these
extreme weather conditions could result in increased wave and wind activity, which would make it more challenging to sail and dock our ships and could cause sea/motion sickness among guests and crew. These events could have an adverse impact on the
safety and guest satisfaction of cruising and could have an adverse impact on our sales and profitability. Finally, these extreme weather conditions could cause property damage to our ships, port facilities and other assets and impact our ability to
obtain insurance coverage for operations in such areas at reasonable rates.

Furthermore, some of the same factors that impact our
guests’ decisions to cruise with us may also impact our ability to employ qualified crew.







•The international political climate, armed conflicts, terrorist and pirate attacks, vessel seizures, and threats thereof, and other world
events affecting the safety and security of travel could adversely affect the demand for cruises and could harm our future sales and profitability.

Demand for cruises and other vacation options has been and is expected to continue to be affected by the public’s attitude towards the safety and security of travel. Factors including, but not
limited to, past acts of terrorism, threats of additional terrorist attacks, drug-related violence in Mexico, pirate attacks and vessel seizures off the coasts of Africa, national government travel advisories, political instability in North Africa,
the Middle East and elsewhere and general concerns over the safety and security aspects of traveling have had a significant adverse impact on demand and pricing in the travel and vacation industry in the past and may have an adverse impact in the
future. Decreases in demand may lead to price reductions, which in turn could reduce our profitability. These types of events could also impact our ability to source qualified crew from throughout the world at competitive costs and, therefore,
increase our shipboard crew costs.



•Negative publicity concerning the cruise business in general or us in particular, including any adverse environmental impacts of cruising,
could impact the demand for cruises, affect our reputation and harm our future sales and profitability.

Incidents
involving cruise ships, and, in particular our cruise ships, media coverage thereof, as well as adverse media publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry in general, or unusual weather patterns or other natural disasters or disruptions, such
as hurricanes and earthquakes, could impact demand for our cruises. In addition, any events which impact the travel industry more generally may negatively impact guests’ ability or desire to travel to or from our ships, or interrupt our ability
to obtain services and goods from key vendors in our supply chain. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our result of operations and on future industry performance.

Maintaining a good reputation is critical to our business. Reports and media coverage of ship incidents at sea or while in port, including missing guests, improper conduct by our employees, guests or
agents, crimes, crew and guest illnesses such as incidents of stomach flu, parasitic outbreaks or other contagious diseases, security breaches, terrorist threats and attacks and other adverse events can result in negative publicity, which could lead
to a negative perception regarding the safety of our ships and the satisfaction of our guests. In addition, negative publicity regarding adverse environmental impacts of cruising, such as climate change and oil spills, could diminish our reputation.
The considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years has increased the ways in which our reputation can be impacted, and the speed with which it can occur. Anything that damages our reputation, whether or not justified, could have
an adverse impact on demand, which could lead to price reductions and a reduction in our sales and profitability.



•Litigation, enforcement actions, fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations and damage our
reputation.

Our business is subject to various international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement
actions, fines, civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages. In addition, improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation and lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in
significant awards or settlements to plaintiffs and civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines. Such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

As a result of any ship or other incidents, such as theCosta Concordiaincident, litigation claims, enforcement actions and regulatory actions
and investigations, including, but not limited to, those arising from personal injury, loss of life, loss of or damage to personal property, business interruption losses or environmental damage to any affected coastal waters and the surrounding
area, may be asserted or brought against various parties including us and/or our cruise brands. The time and attention of our management may also be diverted in defending such claims, actions and investigations. Subject to applicable insurance
coverage, we may also incur costs both in defending against any claims, actions and investigations and for any judgments, fines, civil or criminal penalties if such claims, actions or investigations are adversely determined.



•We are subject to many economic, market and political factors that are beyond our control, which could increase our operating, financing and
other costs and could harm future sales and profitability.

Some of our operating costs including, but not limited to,
food, payroll, port costs, repairs and maintenance, security and other commodity-based items are subject to increases because of market forces, economic or political instability or other circumstances beyond our control. In addition, interest rates,
currency exchange rate fluctuations and our ability to obtain debt or equity financing are dependent on many economic, market and political factors. Increases in operating or financing costs could adversely affect our results because we may not be
able to recover these increased costs through price increases charged to our guests and such increases may adversely impact our liquidity and credit ratings.

It is possible that jurisdictions or ports-of-call that we regularly visit may also decide to assess new taxes or fees or change existing taxes or fees specifically targeted to the cruise business, its
employees and guests, including, but not limited to, value added taxes on cruise tickets and onboard revenues and changes in the scope of income that is includable within tonnage tax regimes, which could increase our operating costs and could
decrease the demand for cruises and ultimately decrease our net revenue yields and net income.







•Changes in and compliance with environmental laws and regulations could adversely affect our operations and thus impact our profitability.

Some environmental groups have lobbied for more stringent regulation of cruise ships. Some groups have also generated
negative publicity about the cruise business and its environmental impact. Various agencies and regulatory organizations have enacted or are considering new regulations or policies, such as requirements to use lower sulfur content fuels and stricter
emission limits to reduce GHG effects, which could adversely impact the cruise business.

The IMO has amended the MARPOL regulations to reduce
emissions from ships. As described in “Maritime Environmental Regulations” as referenced below, these changes will result in reductions in ship sulfur oxide emissions by requiring progressive reductions in the sulfur content in fuel or the
use of abatement technologies. These limits will be further reduced in designated ECAs, including ECAs that have been or could be proposed in other prime cruising areas, such as around Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, the Mediterranean Sea and
Mexico. As a result of these amendments, low sulfur fuel may be less available because of increased demand, and the cost of such fuel may increase. If utilized, new sulfur emissions abatement technologies may also increase costs. The increase
in fuel prices impacts not only our fuel costs, but also some of our other expenses, including, but not limited to, crew and guest travel, freight and commodity prices and may have an adverse impact on our profitability.

Initiatives to limit GHG emissions have recently been introduced in Australia and are being considered in several European countries. Similarly, numerous
bills related to climate change have been introduced in the U.S. Congress, which could adversely impact our business. For example, while not all are likely to become law, there are indications that additional climate change related mandates could be
forthcoming, and they may significantly impact our costs, including, among other things, increasing fuel prices, including new taxes on bunker fuel, establishment of costly emissions trading schemes and increasing newbuild and operational costs.

Current and future environmental laws and regulations, or liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous
substances or vessel discharges, including ballast water and waste disposal, could materially increase our cost of compliance or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. See Part I, Item 1.
Business. B. “Cruise Business- Governmental Regulations—Maritime Regulations” for additional information regarding these risks.



•Changes in and compliance with laws and regulations relating to the protection of persons with disabilities, employment, health, safety,
security and other regulations under which we operate could increase our costs.

We are subject to various international,
national, state and local laws, regulations, treaties and employee union agreements related to, among other things, persons with disabilities, employment, health, safety and security. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to
enforcement actions, fines, civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages. These issues are, and we believe will continue to be, an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world. Accordingly, new
legislation, regulations or treaties, or changes thereto, could impact our operations and would likely subject us to increased compliance costs in the future. In addition, training of crew may become more time consuming and may increase our
operating costs due to increasing regulatory and other requirements.



•Changes in and compliance with income tax laws and regulations and income tax treaties may adversely affect the taxation of our shipping
income and our profitability.

We believe that substantially all of the income earned by Carnival Corporation, Carnival
plc and their ship owning or operating subsidiaries qualifies for taxation based on ship tonnage, are exempt from taxation or are otherwise subject to minimal taxes in the jurisdictions where the entities are incorporated or do business.

We believe that Panama and the jurisdictions where the ship owning and operating subsidiaries of Carnival Corporation are formed are equivalent exemption
jurisdictions for purposes of Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code. The laws of Panama and the other jurisdictions where our ships are owned or operated are subject to change and, in the future, may no longer qualify as equivalent exemption
jurisdictions.

The IRS interpretation of Section 883 could differ materially from ours. In addition, provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code, including Section 883, are subject to legislative change at any time. Moreover, changes could occur in the future with respect to the trading volume or trading frequency of Carnival Corporation shares. Accordingly, it is possible that
Carnival Corporation and its ship-owning or operating subsidiaries whose tax exemption is based on Section 883 could lose this exemption.

There is no authority that directly addresses the effect, if any, of a DLC arrangement on the availability of benefits under treaties and, accordingly,
their application to our operations is not free from doubt. The applicable treaties may be revoked by either applicable country, replaced or modified with new agreements that treat income from international operation of ships differently than the
agreements currently in force or may be interpreted by one of its countries differently from us.







If we did not qualify for tonnage tax, exemption, treaties or minimal taxes, or if the laws that provide for
these tax systems were changed, we would have significantly higher income tax expense. In many jurisdictions, the benefit of tonnage tax or preferential tax regimes would be replaced with taxation at normal statutory rates. In the absence of
Section 883 or an applicable income tax treaty in the U.S., we would be subject to the net income and branch profits tax regimes of Section 882 and Section 884 of the Internal Revenue Code. In combination, these provisions would
result in the taxation of our U.S. source shipping income, net of applicable deductions, at a current federal corporate income tax rate of up to 35%, state income tax rates would vary and our net after-tax income would be potentially subject to a
further branch profits tax of 30%.

We are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by tax authorities in the
jurisdictions where we operate. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcome from these examinations
will not adversely affect our net income.

As budgetary constraints continue to adversely impact the jurisdictions in which we operate,
increases in income tax regulations affecting our operations may be imposed. We continue to monitor global administrative, legislative and judicial tax related developments and evaluate a variety of possible courses of action based upon such
developments. However, there is no assurance that such actions, if taken, will successfully mitigate adverse income tax consequences.



•Our ability to implement our shipbuilding programs and ship repairs, maintenance and refurbishments on terms that are favorable or consistent
with our expectations could reduce our profitability. In addition, we expect increases to our repairs and maintenance expenses and refurbishment costs as our fleet ages.

Also, the European shipyards that build most of our ships are currently eligible to benefit from governmental support of innovation, development,
employment and export credit financing that expire in 2013. There is no assurance that such eligibility will be extended or renewed and, therefore, we may incur higher vessel purchase prices and financing costs.

As of November 30, 2012, we had entered into foreign currency zero cost collars for a portion of the cost in U.S. dollars and sterling of two of our
euro-denominated shipbuilding contracts. However, if the shipyard with which we have contracted is unable to perform under the related contracts, the foreign currency zero cost collars related to the shipyard’s shipbuilding contract payments
would still have to be honored. This might require us to realize a loss on existing foreign currency zero cost collars without an offsetting gain on our foreign currency denominated shipbuilding contract payments, thus resulting in an adverse effect
on our financial results.

The cost of shipbuilding orders that we may place in the future that is denominated in a different currency than
our cruise brands’ or the shipyards’ functional currency is expected to be affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. These foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect our desire to order new cruise ships. In
addition, the prices of various commodities that are used in the construction of ships, such as steel, can be subject to volatile price changes and, accordingly, the cost of future newbuilds may increase, which could have an adverse impact on our
profitability.

In connection with our shipbuilding contracts, we do not anticipate any contractual breakage or cancellations on our part.
However, if any were to occur, it could result in, among other things, the forfeiture of our payments and the imposition of contractual liquidated damages.







•Lack of continuing availability of attractive, convenient and safe port destinations could adversely affect our net revenue yields and net
income.

We believe that attractive, convenient and safe port destinations, including ports that are not overly congested
with tourists, are major reasons why our guests choose a cruise versus an alternative vacation option. The continuing availability of these types of ports, including the port facilities where our guests embark and disembark, is affected by a number
of factors including, but not limited to, existing capacity constraints (particularly during the Caribbean winter months and Mediterranean summer months), security, safety and environmental concerns, adverse weather conditions and other natural
disasters, financial limitations on port development, political instability, exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors, local governmental regulations and fees and local community concerns about both port development and
other adverse impacts on their communities from additional tourists. The inability to continue to utilize, maintain, rebuild, if necessary, and increase the number of ports that our ships call on could adversely affect our net revenue yields and net
income.



•Continuing financial viability of our travel agent distribution system, air service providers and other key vendors in our supply chain is essential
to allowing us to profitably operate our business. In addition, reductions in the availability of, and increases in the prices for, the services and products provided by these vendors can adversely impact our net income.

The majority of our guests book their cruises through independent travel agents, including wholesalers, general sales
agents and tour operators. These parties generally sell and market our cruises on a nonexclusive basis. Our competitors may offer higher commissions and incentives and thus adversely impact our business. Significant disruptions, contractions or
consolidations to our travel agent distribution system, such as those caused by a reduction in travel and related commission income as a result of an economic slowdown could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability. In addition, we
extend credit to certain of our larger European travel agents and tour operators and, accordingly, if such agents and operators cannot repay their debts to us, it will adversely impact our cash flows and operations.

Many of our guests and substantially all our crew depend on scheduled or chartered commercial airline services to transport them to or from the airports
near the ports where our cruises embark and disembark. Changes or disruptions in commercial or chartered airline services as a result of strikes, labor unrest, financial instability or viability, adverse weather conditions, airport delays,
consolidation of carriers, or other events or the lack of availability due to schedule changes or a high level of airline bookings could adversely affect our ability to deliver guests and crew to or from our cruise ships and increase our cost of
sales which would, in turn, have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, increases in the prices of airfares due to rising fuel prices would increase the overall vacation price to our guests and may adversely affect demand for
our cruises, as well as increase our airfare for our crew.

Travel agents may face increased pressure from our competitors, particularly in
the North America market, to sell and market these competitor cruises exclusively. If such exclusive arrangements were introduced, there can be no assurance that we will be able to find alternative distribution channels to ensure our customer base
would not be affected.

Economic downturns may impact the financial viability of other key vendors in our supply chain and the interruption in
the services or goods we purchase from them could adversely impact our operations and profitability.



•Disruptions and other damages to our information technology and other networks and operations, and breaches in data security could result in
decreases in our net income.

Our ability to increase revenues and control costs, as well as our ability to serve guests
most effectively depends in part on the reliability of our sophisticated information technology (“IT”) systems and other networks. We use IT, communications and other systems among other things, to manage our inventory of cabins held for
sale and set pricing in order to maximize our revenue yields and to optimize the effectiveness and efficiency of our shoreside and shipboard operations. Gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or
sensitive information, corrupting data, causing operational disruptions and other cyber-related risks could adversely impact our guest services and satisfaction, employee relationships and our reputation.

These potential disruptions and cyber attacks could negatively affect costs, customer demand and pricing for our cruises. In addition, the operation and
maintenance of these IT systems and networks is in some cases dependent on third-party technologies, systems and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability. While we have and continue to invest in IT and other
security initiatives and disaster recovery plans, these measures cannot completely insulate us from disruptions that could result in adverse effects on our operations and decreases in our net income.

Our Corporate and cruise brands’ principal offices are located in the U.S., Australia, Continental Europe and the UK. Although we have developed
disaster recovery and similar contingency plans, actual or threatened natural disasters (for example, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornados, fires and floods) or similar events in these locations may have a material impact on our business continuity,
reputation and results of operations.







•A failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position.

Our business continues to demand the use of sophisticated systems and technology. These systems and technologies must be refined, updated and replaced
with more advanced systems on a regular basis. If we are unable to do so on a timely basis or within reasonable cost parameters, our business could suffer. We also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new system or technology,
such as fuel abatement technologies, and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results.



•We may lose business to competitors throughout the vacation industry, which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.

We face significant competition from other cruise brands on the basis of cruise pricing, travel agent preference and the
types and sizes of ships and cabins, services and destinations being offered by them to cruise guests. We try to differentiate ourselves from our cruise competitors by offering a wide variety of brands, itineraries, products and services to our
guests, but the acceptance of each offering is not certain and consumers’ preferences are always subject to change. In addition, we may choose to enhance our older ships with innovative amenities and improvements in order for those ships to be
more competitive with other cruise ships.

In addition, we operate in the vacation industry and cruising is only one of many alternatives for
people choosing a vacation. We therefore risk losing business not only to other cruise lines, but also to vacation operators that provide other travel and leisure options, including, but not limited to, hotels, resorts, theme parks, packaged
holidays and tours, casino operators and vacation ownership properties.

In the event that we do not compete effectively with other cruise
companies and other vacation alternatives, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.



•Overcapacity in the cruise ship or land-based vacation industry could have a negative impact on our net revenue yields and increase operating
costs, thus resulting in ship, goodwill and trademark asset impairments, all of which could adversely affect profitability.

Although cruising capacity has grown at a slower pace in recent years, we expect it to continue to increase over the next few years. The overall vacation industry may also face increases in land-based
vacation capacity, which may impact us as well. We aim to fill our new capacity at favorable revenue yields despite the new competing cruise and land-based capacity growth. Also, to the extent that we or our competitors deploy ships to a particular
itinerary and the resulting capacity in that region exceeds the demand, we may lower pricing and profitability may be lower than anticipated. Should net revenue yields be negatively impacted, our results of operations and financial condition could
be adversely affected, including the impairment of the value of our ships, goodwill and trademark assets. In addition, increased cruise capacity could impact our ability to retain and attract qualified crew, including officers, at competitive rates
and, therefore, increase our shipboard employee costs.



•The loss of key personnel or our ability to recruit or retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our results of operations.

We rely upon the ability, expertise, judgment, discretion, integrity and good faith of our senior management team. Our
success is also dependent upon our personnel and our ability to recruit and train high quality employees. We must continue to recruit, retain and motivate management and other employees to enable us to maintain our current business and support our
projected growth. The loss of services of any of our key management could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are not protected by life insurance covering any of our personnel. We do not have employment agreements with substantially
all of our officers.



•Union disputes and other employee relation issues could adversely affect our financial results.

A large number of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying
durations and expiration dates. We may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements when they expire. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage on our ships
in the future. We may also be subject to or affected by work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements. Any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.



•The impact of disruptions in the global financial markets or other events may negatively affect the ability of our counterparties and others
to perform their obligations to us and thus, adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.

The
ability of our counterparties to perform, primarily with respect to our cash equivalents, investments, committed financing facilities, contingent obligations, derivative instruments, insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees, may
adversely impact us if any of their financial positions weaken materially or they suffer other financial disruptions.







For example, the recent severe economic downturn, including failures of financial service companies and the
related liquidity crisis, disrupted the capital and credit markets. Additional economic concerns from some of the countries in the EU continue to strain the financial markets both in the U.S. and internationally. A recurrence of these disruptions
could cause our counterparties and others to breach their obligations to us under our contracts with them. This could include failures of banks or other financial service companies to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements or to pay us
amounts that may become due under our derivative contracts for fuel, interest rates and foreign currencies or other agreements. If any of the foregoing occurs it may have a negative impact on our cash flows, including our ability to meet our
obligations, results of operations and financial condition.



•Our success depends upon the continued strength of our cruise brands and our ability to implement our brand strategies.

We believe that our cruise branding has contributed significantly to the success of our business and that maintaining
and enhancing our branding is critical to expanding our brands’ customer bases. In addition, the ability of our brands to successfully target different segments of the vacation markets in which they operate enables them to strengthen their
business. Failure to protect our brands from infringers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.



•Our international operations are subject to additional risks not generally applicable to our U.S. operations and may result in increased costs and
adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.

Our international operations are subject to
additional risks including, but not limited to, adverse changes in foreign countries’ political systems; social unrest; restrictions and taxes on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings and other payments by subsidiaries; government
policies against the vacation or maritime industries; local cabotage requirements; anti-bribery laws or regulations; investment restrictions or requirements; diminished ability to legally enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights in
foreign countries and commercial instability caused by corruption. In addition, our international operations may also be subject to adverse changes in foreign exchange restrictions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in or
application of foreign taxation structures including duties and value-added taxes. Also, if a significant country leaves the euro currency system it is possible that this could have a significant impact on our operations. If we are unable to address
these risks adequately, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Operating internationally also exposes
us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements. In many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate, practices in the local business communities might not conform to international business standards. We
may not be successful in ensuring that our employees and other representatives stationed throughout the world properly adhere to our policies or applicable laws or regulations. Failure to adhere to our policies or applicable laws or regulations
could result in penalties, sanctions, damage to our reputation and related costs, which in turn could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows.



•Geographic regions in which we try to expand our business may be slow to develop and ultimately not develop how we expect, thus resulting in the
slower growth of our business.

As we expand our global presence it requires, among other things, significant levels of
investments. We may not recover our investments in these markets, and we cannot be certain that these markets will ultimately develop as we expect. Accordingly, our business expansion may not produce the returns that we had expected, which could
adversely impact the growth of our business.



•Our decisions to self-insure against various risks or the inability to obtain insurance for certain risks at reasonable rates could result in
higher expenses or lower revenues.

We seek to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage at commercially reasonable
rates. We believe that our current coverage is adequate to protect us against most of the significant risks involved in the conduct of our business, although we do elect to self-insure or use higher deductibles for substantially all the insurable
risks we face in order to minimize the cost of our insurance policies. Accordingly, we are not protected against all risks, such as loss of use of a ship, which could result in an unexpected decrease in our revenue in the event of an incident.
We attempt to mitigate our risks that are not covered by insurance, although we cannot be certain such processes and procedures will be successful. Further, significant incidents could result in higher insurance premiums commencing on the policy
renewal dates.

We may also be subject to additional premium costs in amounts based not only on our own claims record but also on the claims
records of all other members of the P&I associations through which we receive indemnity coverage for tort liability. We are also subject to additional P&I premium assessments for various reasons including, but not limited to, investment or
underwriting shortfalls experienced by our P&I clubs. In addition, if we or other ship-owners sustain significant losses, our ability to obtain future insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates could be materially adversely affected.







Finally, we cannot be certain that affordable and viable direct insurance and reinsurance markets will be
available to us in the future.



•Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results.

We earn revenues, pay expenses, purchase and own assets and incur liabilities in currencies other than the U.S. dollar; most importantly, the euro,
sterling and Australian and Canadian dollars. We derived 54%, 56% and 54% of our revenues from passengers sourced from countries outside of the U.S. in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in
U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Further, we report currency transactions in the functional
currencies of our reporting units, excluding fuel which is always transacted and reported in U.S. dollars regardless of the functional currency of the reporting unit. Therefore, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against our other major
currencies, will adversely affect our U.S. dollar financial results.



•Whether our future operating cash flow will be sufficient to fund future obligations and whether we will be able to obtain financing, if
necessary, in sufficient amounts and on terms that are favorable or consistent with our expectations may adversely impact our financial results.

Our forecasted cash flows from future operations may be adversely affected by various factors, including, but not limited to, declines in guest demand and consumer confidence; a weakening economy;
increased competition; overcapacity; terrorist and pirate attacks and the threats thereof; the impact of the spread of contagious diseases such as influenza virus; ship incidents; negative publicity; adverse currency movements; increases in fuel
prices and other factors noted under these “Risk Factors.” To the extent that we are required, or choose, to fund future cash requirements, including current and future shipbuilding commitments and debt repayments, from sources other than
cash flow from operations, available cash and committed external sources of liquidity, including committed ship and other financings, we will have to secure such financing from export credit agencies or banks or through the offering of debt and
equity securities in the public or private markets. There is no guarantee that such financings will be available in the future to fund our future obligations, or that they will be available on terms consistent with our expectations.

Our access to and the cost of financing will depend on, among other things, conditions in the global financing markets, the availability of sufficient
amounts of financing and the maintenance of our investment grade long-term senior unsecured credit ratings. If our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings were to be downgraded or assigned a negative outlook, our access to, and cost of, debt
financing may be negatively impacted. Further, the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants, which may restrict our business operations.

Our ability to maintain our credit facilities may also be impacted by material changes in our ownership. More specifically, we may be required to prepay our debt facilities if a person or group of persons
acting in concert gain control of Carnival Corporation & plc, other than the Arison family, including Micky Arison, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.



•The DLC arrangement involves risks not associated with the more common ways of combining the operations of two companies and these risks may
have an adverse effect on the economic performance of the companies and their respective share prices.

The DLC
arrangement is a relatively uncommon way of combining the management and operations of two companies and it involves different issues and risks from those associated with the other more common ways of impacting a business combination, such as a
merger or exchange offer to create a wholly owned subsidiary. In our DLC arrangement, the combination is effected primarily by means of contracts between Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc and not by operation of a statute or court order. The
legal effect of these contractual rights may be different from the legal effect of a merger or amalgamation under statute or court order, and there may be difficulties in enforcing these contractual rights. Shareholders and creditors of either
company might challenge the validity of the contracts or their lack of standing to enforce rights under these contracts, and courts may interpret or enforce these contracts in a manner inconsistent with the express provisions and intentions we
included in such contracts. In addition, shareholders and creditors of other companies might successfully challenge other DLC arrangements and establish legal precedents that could increase the risk of a successful challenge to our DLC arrangement.



•Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc are not U.S. corporations, and our shareholders may be subject to the uncertainties of a foreign legal
system in protecting their interests.

Carnival Corporation’s corporate affairs are governed by its Third Amended
and Restated Articles of Incorporation (“Articles”) and Third Amended and Restated By-Laws (“By-Laws”) and by the laws of Panama. Carnival plc is governed by its Articles of Association and by the laws of England and Wales.
The contracts that control the relationship between Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc under the DLC arrangement are governed by the laws of Panama, the Isle of Man and the Cayman Islands. The laws of Panama, England and Wales, the Isle of Man
and the Cayman Islands may differ in some respects from the laws in the U.S. Thus, our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interest with respect to actions by management, directors and controlling shareholders than would
otherwise be the case for a U.S. shareholder in a U.S. Corporation or a UK shareholder in a UK Corporation.







•A small group of shareholders owns a significant portion of the total combined voting power of our outstanding shares and may be able to
effectively control the outcome of shareholder voting.

As of January 22, 2013, a small group of shareholders
consisting of some members of the Arison family, including Micky Arison, beneficially owned approximately 27% of the total combined voting power of Carnival Corporation & plc. Depending upon the nature and extent of the shareholder vote,
this group of shareholders may have the power to effectively control, or at least significantly influence, the outcome of certain shareholder votes and, therefore, the corporate actions requiring such votes.



•Provisions in Carnival Corporation’s and Carnival plc’s constitutional documents may prevent or discourage takeovers and business
combinations that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interests.

Carnival Corporation’s Articles
and By-Laws and Carnival plc’s Articles of Association contain provisions that may delay, defer, prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our shareholders consider to be in their best interests. As a result, these provisions may
prevent our shareholders from receiving a premium to the market price of our shares offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market
price of our shares if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.

Specifically, Carnival Corporation’s Articles
contain provisions that prevent third parties, other than the Arison family and trusts established for their benefit, from acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 4.9% of outstanding Carnival Corporation shares without the consent of its Board
of Directors and provide for the lapse of rights, and sale, of any shares acquired in excess of that limit. The effect of these provisions may preclude third parties from seeking to acquire a controlling interest in us in transactions that
shareholders might consider to be in their best interests and may prevent them from receiving a premium above market price for their shares.
