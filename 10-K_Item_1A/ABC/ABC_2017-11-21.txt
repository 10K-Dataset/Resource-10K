ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS

The following discussion describes certain risk factors that we believe could affect our business and prospects. These risk factors are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this report.

Our results of operations could be adversely impacted by manufacturer pricing changes and fewer generic pharmaceutical launches.

In fiscal 2017, we experienced unfavorable trends in brand and generic pharmaceutical pricing which negatively impacted our Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment profit and our consolidated operating earnings. Those trends are expected to continue in fiscal 2018, and could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations.



Certain distribution service agreements that we have entered into with branded and generic pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to have an inflation-based compensation component to them. As a result, our gross profit from brand-name and generic manufacturers continues to be subject to fluctuation based upon the timing and extent of manufacturer price increases, which we do not control. If the frequency or rate of branded and generic pharmaceutical price increases slows, our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, generic pharmaceuticals are also subject to price deflation. If the frequency or rate of generic pharmaceutical price deflation accelerates, the negative impact on our results of operations will be greater. A decline in the number of generic pharmaceutical launches, or launches that are less profitable than those in the past, could also adversely impact our results of operations.

Competition and industry consolidation may erode our profit.

As described in greater detail in the “Competition” section beginning on page 5, the industries in which we operate are highly competitive. In addition, in recent years the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation, including among pharmaceutical manufacturers. If we do not compete successfully, it could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The impact on us will be greater if consolidation among our customers, suppliers, and competitors gives the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power, which could lead to greater pressure on us to reduce prices for our products and services.

Increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel and pharmaceutical compounding may increase our costs and reduce our profitability.

The healthcare industry in the United States is highly regulated at the federal and state levels. There have been increasing efforts by Congress and state and federal agencies, including state boards of pharmacy, departments of health, and the FDA, to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system and pharmacy compounding activities. Regulation of pharmaceutical distribution is intended to prevent diversion and the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated, and/or mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system. Consequently, we are subject to the risk of changes in various federal and state laws, which include operating and security standards of the DEA, the FDA, various state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies. In recent years, some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety and security of the supply channel but that also may substantially increase the costs and burden of pharmaceutical distribution and pharmaceutical compounding.

One additional change resulting from the DQSA is the creation of Section 503B outsourcing facilities as a new category for producers of compounded sterile preparations ("CSPs"), allowing such facilities to voluntarily register with the FDA. Our CSP business locations have registered with the FDA as Section 503B outsourcing facilities and have implemented policies and procedures to achieve compliance with current DQSA requirements for such facilities. However, there can be no assurance that









we are fully compliant with the new requirements, and any failure to comply may result in additional costs to bring our CSP facilities into compliance. Moreover, the FDA will continue to issue draft and final guidance and to promulgate regulations in its efforts to implement the requirements in the DQSA, including those relating to current good manufacturing practices ("GMPs") and other matters related to 503B outsourcing facilities, which may require changes to our CSP business, some of which may be significant. Complying with these and other chain of custody and pharmaceutical compounding requirements will increase our costs and could otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.

Legal, regulatory and legislative changes may adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Both our business and our customers' businesses may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and/or medical treatments or services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined. Additionally, on occasion, price increases on certain branded and generic pharmaceuticals have been the subject of U.S. Congressional inquiries. Any law or regulation impacting pharmaceutical pricing, including as a result of pricing controls or legislative efforts at the federal or state level, could adversely affect our operations.

Federal insurance and health care reform legislation known as the Affordable Care Act ("ACA") became law in March 2010. The ACA is intended to expand health insurance coverage, including coverage for at least a portion of drug costs, through a combination of insurance market reforms, an expansion of Medicaid, subsidies, and health insurance mandates. The ACA contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and reduce the costs of Medicare and Medicaid. Given the scope of the changes made by the ACA and the ongoing implementation efforts, we cannot predict the impact of every aspect of the law on our operations. Likewise, we cannot predict the impact of any efforts to change or repeal any provisions of the ACA.

The ACA changed the formula for Medicaid federal upper payment limits (“FULs”) for multiple source drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis to a limit of not less than 175% of the weighted average manufacturer price ("AMP"). On February 1, 2016, CMS published its final rule to implement the ACA's Medicaid covered outpatient drug provisions, under which CMS calculates FULs for multiple source drugs as 175% of the weighted average of AMPs, with certain exceptions. In addition, the rule requires state Medicaid programs to implement payment methods for brand (non-multiple source) products designed to be consistent with the actual acquisition cost of such drugs. The rule was generally effective on April 1, 2016, and states had until May 2016 to implement the FULs and have until April 1, 2017 to implement any changes necessary in light of the actual acquisition cost standard. Medicaid reimbursement for drugs calculated under the final rule may represent significant reductions from prior reimbursement levels, although the impact of the changes depends upon how the changes are implemented by each state Medicaid program. Any reduction in the Medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers may indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers for multisource pharmaceuticals and cause corresponding declines in our profitability.

The ACA also amended the Medicaid rebate statute to increase minimum Medicaid rebates paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers and made other changes expected to result in increased Medicaid rebate payments by pharmaceutical manufacturers, which could indirectly impact our business. In addition, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 extended to generic drugs inflation-based Medicaid drug rebates similar to those that are paid on brand drugs. The federal government and state governments could take other actions in the future that impact Medicaid reimbursement and rebate amounts or the cost of drugs.

There can be no assurance that recent or future changes in Medicaid prescription drug reimbursement policies will not have an adverse impact on our business. Unless we are able to develop plans to mitigate the potential impact of these legislative and regulatory changes, these changes in reimbursement and related reporting requirements could adversely affect our results of operations.

The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 significantly expanded Medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs through the Medicare Part D program. The Part D program has increased the use of pharmaceuticals in the supply channel, which has had a positive impact on our revenues and profitability. There have been additional legislative and regulatory changes to the Part D program since its enactment. There can be no assurances that recent and future changes to the Part D program will not have an adverse impact on our business.

The federal government may adopt measures in the future that would further reduce Medicare and/or Medicaid spending or impose additional requirements on health care entities. For instance, under the "sequestration" provision of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (as amended), a 2% cut is being made to Medicare provider and plan payments, generally effective for services provided on or after April 1, 2013. Any future reductions in Medicare reimbursement rates could negatively impact our customers' businesses and their ability to continue to purchase such drugs from us. At this time, we can provide no assurances that future Medicare and/or Medicaid payment or policy changes, if adopted, would not have an adverse effect on our business.









Our business may be adversely affected in the future by the impact of declining reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and other economic factors.

Changes to the U.S. healthcare environment may negatively impact our business and our profitability.

Our products and services are intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently existing in the United States. In recent years, the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending. These changes include an increased reliance on managed care; cuts in certain Medicare funding affecting our healthcare provider customer base; consolidation of competitors, suppliers and customers; and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing groups. We expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future. Some of these potential changes, such as a reduction in governmental funding at the state or federal level for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing, pharmaceutical compounding, healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services. We expect continued government and private payor pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing. Changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers' pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability.

If we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud and abuse, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.









Public concern over the abuse of opioid medications, including increased legal and regulatory action, could negatively affect our business.





Our business, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected by qui tam litigation or other legal proceedings.

Our business involves the manufacture, distribution, and dispensing of healthcare products, which may cause us to become involved in legal disputes or proceedings. The defense and resolutions of these current and future proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Violations of various federal and state laws governing the marketing, sale, purchase, and dispensing of pharmaceutical products can result in criminal, civil, and administrative liability for which there can be significant financial damages, criminal and civil penalties, and possible exclusion from participation in federal and state health programs. Any settlement, judgment or fine that is in excess of our insurance limits, or that is not otherwise covered, could adversely affect our results of operations.

Among other things, statutory and/or regulatory violations can form the basis for qui tam complaints to be filed. The qui tam provisions of the federal and various state civil False Claims Acts authorize a private person, known as a relator, to file civil actions under these statutes on behalf of the federal and state governments. Under False Claims Acts, the filing of a qui tam complaint by a relator imposes obligations on government authorities to investigate the allegations and determine whether or not to intervene in the action. Such cases may involve allegations around the marketing, sale, purchase, and/or dispensing of branded and/or generic pharmaceutical products and wrongdoing in the marketing, sale, purchase, and/or dispensing of such products. Such complaints are filed under seal and remain sealed until the applicable court orders otherwise.

We have learned that there are filings in one or more federal district courts that are under seal and may involve allegations against us (and/or our subsidiaries or businesses, including our group purchasing organization for oncologists and our oncology distribution business) relating to its distribution of certain pharmaceutical products to providers. With regard to any of these filings, our business, and results of operations could be adversely affected if qui tam complaints are filed against us for alleged violations of any health laws and regulations and damages arising from resultant false claims, if the litigation proceeds whether or not government authorities decide to intervene in any such matters and/or if we are found liable for all or any portion of violations alleged in any such matters.

Our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows may suffer upon the loss, or renewal at less favorable terms, of a significant customer or group purchasing organization.

WBA accounted for approximately30%of our revenue in the fiscal year ended September 30,2017. Express Scripts accounted for approximately15%of our revenue in the fiscal year ended September 30,2017. Our top ten customers, including governmental agencies and GPOs, represented approximately66%of revenue in the fiscal year ended September 30,2017. We may lose a significant customer or GPO relationship if any existing contract with such customer or GPO expires without being extended, renewed, renegotiated or replaced or is terminated by the customer or GPO prior to expiration, to the extent such early termination is permitted by the contract. A number of our contracts with significant customers or GPOs are typically subject to expiration each year and we may lose any of these customers or GPO relationships if we are unable to extend, renew, renegotiate or replace the contracts. The loss of any significant customer or GPO relationship could adversely affect our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows. Additionally, from time to time, significant contracts may be renewed prior to their expiration date. If those contracts are renewed at less favorable terms, they may also negatively impact our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows.









The anticipated ongoing strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with WBA may not be realized.

In addition, WBA has the right, but not the obligation, under the transactions contemplated by the Framework and Shareholder Agreements dated March 18, 2013 to make certain additional investments in our common stock. WBA also has the right to sell any of the shares of our common stock that it has acquired so long as WBA has held the shares beyond the requisite dates specified in the Shareholder Agreement. Any sales in the public market of common stock currently held by WBA or acquired by WBA pursuant to open market purchases could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. We could also encounter unforeseen costs, circumstances, or issues with respect to the transactions and collaboration we anticipate pursuing with WBA. Many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased benefits and the diversion of management time and attention. If we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected future benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and the price of our common stock.

A disruption in our distribution or generic purchasing services arrangements with WBA could adversely affect our business and financial results.

We are the primary distributor of pharmaceutical products for WBA. Our generic pharmaceutical program has also benefited from the generics purchasing services arrangement with WBA. If the operations of WBA are seriously disrupted for any reason, whether by natural disaster, labor disruption, regulatory or governmental action, or otherwise, it could adversely affect our business and our sales and profitability. If the generics purchasing services arrangement does not continue to be successful, our margins and results of operations could also be adversely affected.

If our operations are seriously disrupted for any reason, we may have an obligation to pay or credit WBA for failure to supply products. In addition, upon the expiration or termination of the distribution agreement or generics purchasing services arrangement, there can be no assurance that we or WBA will be willing to renew, on terms favorable to us or at all.

In addition, our business may be adversely affected by any operational, financial or regulatory difficulties that WBA experiences, including any disruptions of certain of its existing distribution facilities or retail pharmacies resulting from ongoing inspections by the DEA and/or state regulatory agencies and possible revocation of the controlled substance registrations for those facilities and pharmacies.

Tax legislation or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We are a large corporation with operations in the United States and select global markets. As such, we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and local governments, and of various foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, various legislative initiatives, such as the repeal of last-in, first-out ("LIFO") treatment, may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions and/or our tax liabilities. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives. We believe that our historical tax positions are consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and existing precedent. In addition, U.S. federal, state and local, as well as foreign, tax laws and









regulations, are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.

The suspension or revocation by federal or state authorities of any of the registrations that must be in effect for our distribution and 503B outsourcing facilities to purchase, compound, store, and/or distribute pharmaceuticals and controlled substances, the refusal by such authorities to issue a registration to any such facility, or any enforcement action or other litigation that arises out of our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing distribution and 503B outsourcing facilities may adversely affect our reputation, our business and our results of operations.

We have received, and may in the future receive, requests for information, letters and subpoenas from the DEA, FDA, various U.S. Attorneys' Offices of the U.S. Department of Justice, and/or state attorneys general and state regulatory authorities and agencies related to our distribution of controlled substances and our order monitoring program, which is designed to prevent and detect the illegal diversion of controlled substances, or other matters. We generally respond to subpoenas, requests, letters, and other authority and/or agency correspondence in a thorough and timely manner. These responses require time and effort and can result in considerable costs being incurred by us, such as costs related to addressing the observations listed on FDA Form 483 reports. Such subpoenas, requests and letters can also lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of civil, criminal, or regulatory legal proceedings against us, as well as to settlements and the suspension or revocation of registrations required by our distribution and 503B outsourcing facilities, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations.

The products compounded by our CSP business are administered by our customers to patients intravenously, and failures or errors in production, labeling or packaging could contribute to patient harm or death, which may subject us to significant liabilities and reputational harm.

The production, labeling, and packaging of CSPs is inherently risky. Our CSP business sells CSPs to acute care hospitals, freestanding hospital outpatient departments, and ambulatory surgery centers, who then administer the CSPs to patients intravenously or through other injectable routes of administration. There are a number of factors that could result in the injury or death of a patient who receives one of our CSPs, including quality issues, manufacturing or labeling flaws, improper packaging or unanticipated or improper uses of the products, any of which could result from human or other error. Any of these situations could lead to a recall of, or safety alert relating to, one or more of our products. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we may voluntarily recall or retrieve products. Any recall or retrieval, whether voluntary or requested by the FDA or state regulatory









authorities, could result in significant costs and negative publicity. Negative publicity, including regarding a quality or safety issue, whether accurate or inaccurate, could reduce market acceptance of our products, harm our reputation, decrease demand for our products, result in the loss of customers, lead to product withdrawals, and harm our ability to successfully launch new products and services. These problems could also result in enforcement actions by state and federal authorities or other healthcare self-regulatory bodies, or product liability claims or lawsuits, including those brought by individuals or groups seeking to represent a class or establish multidistrict litigation proceedings. Any such action, litigation, recall or reputational harm resulting from patient harm or death caused by CSPs prepared by a competitor or a hospital pharmacy could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our current or future insurance coverage may prove insufficient to cover any liability claims brought against us. Because of the increasing cost of insurance coverage, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.

We may not realize the expected benefits from our reorganization and other business process initiatives.



In June 2017 we announced a new organizational structure, described in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 below, designed to further align the organization to its customer needs in a more seamless and unified way, while supporting corporate strategy, accelerating growth, and improving efficiency. There can be no assurance that we will realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits of these changes. Our financial goals assume a level of productivity improvement from our business optimization initiatives. Our ability to successfully manage and execute these initiatives and realize expected savings and benefits is important to our business success. The reorganization and other initiatives could yield unintended consequences such as distraction of our management and employees, business disruption, attrition, inability to attract or retain key personnel, and reduced employee productivity which could negatively affect our business, sales, financial condition, and results of operations. Moreover, our restructuring and business process initiatives may result in charges and expenses that impact our operating results. There can be no assurance that the activities under any restructuring and business initiative will result in the desired benefits.



Our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we undertake acquisitions of businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us to integrate.

As part of our strategy we seek to pursue acquisitions of other companies. At any particular time, we may be in various stages of assessment, discussion, and negotiation with regard to one or more potential acquisitions, not all of which will be consummated. We make public disclosure of pending and completed acquisitions when appropriate and required by applicable securities laws and regulations.

Acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties and may be of businesses in which we lack operational experience. If we complete one or more acquisitions, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: regulatory or compliance issues that could arise; changes in regulations and laws; the failure of the acquired businesses to achieve the results we have projected in either the near or long term; the assumption of unknown liabilities, including litigation risks; the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed not being properly estimated; the difficulties of imposing adequate financial and operating controls on the acquired companies and their management and the potential liabilities that might arise pending the imposition of adequate controls; the difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies; and the failure to achieve the strategic objectives of these acquisitions.

Violations of anti-bribery, anti-corruption and/or international trade laws to which we are subject could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations.









Our results of operations and our financial condition may be adversely affected by our global operations.

Our operations in jurisdictions outside of the United States are subject to various risks inherent in global operations. We currently have operations in over50countries worldwide. We may conduct business in additional foreign jurisdictions in the future, which may carry operational risks in addition to the risks of acquisition described above. At any particular time, our global operations may be affected by local changes in laws, regulations, and the political and economic environments, including inflation, recession, currency volatility, and competition. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial position, and results of operations.

Declining economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Our operations and performance depend on economic conditions in the United States and other countries where we do business. Deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and, therefore, could reduce purchases by our customers, which would negatively affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability. Negative trends in the general economy, including interest rate fluctuations, financial market volatility or credit market disruptions, may also affect our customers' ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms and reduce discretionary spending on health products. Reduced purchases by our customers or changes in payment terms could adversely affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our cash flow from operations. Bankruptcies or similar events affecting our customers may cause us to incur bad debt expense at levels higher than historically experienced. Declining economic conditions may also increase our costs. If the economic conditions in the United States or in the countries where we do business do not improve or deteriorate, our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected.

Our stock price and our ability to access credit markets may be adversely affected by financial market volatility and disruption.

If the capital and credit markets experience significant disruption and volatility in the future, there can be no assurance that we will not experience downward movement in our stock price without regard to our financial condition or results of operations or an adverse effect, which may be material, on our ability to access credit. Although we believe that our operating cash flow and existing credit arrangements give us the ability to meet our financing needs, there can be no assurance that disruption and volatility will not increase our costs of borrowing, impair our liquidity, or adversely impact our business.

Our revenue and results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, or other credit failure of a significant customer.

Most of our customers buy pharmaceuticals and other products and services from us on credit. Credit is made available to customers based upon our assessment and analysis of creditworthiness. Although we often try to obtain a security interest in assets and other arrangements intended to protect our credit exposure, we generally are either subordinated to the position of the primary lenders to our customers or substantially unsecured. Volatility of the capital and credit markets, general economic conditions, and regulatory changes, including changes in reimbursement, may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our customers. The bankruptcy, insolvency, or other credit failure of any customer that has a substantial amount owed to us could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenue and results of operations. As ofSeptember 30, 2017, our two largest trade receivable balances due from customers represented approximately49%and9%of accounts receivable, net.

Our results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy, insolvency or other credit failure of a significant supplier.

Our relationships with pharmaceutical suppliers, including generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, give rise to substantial amounts that are due to us from the suppliers, including amounts owed to us for returned goods or defective goods, chargebacks, and amounts due to us for services provided to the suppliers. Volatility of the capital and credit markets, general economic conditions, and regulatory changes may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our suppliers. The bankruptcy, insolvency or other credit failure of any supplier at a time when the supplier has a substantial account payable balance due to us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.









Risks generally associated with our sophisticated information systems may adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Our businesses rely on sophisticated information systems to obtain, rapidly process, analyze, and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers; to receive, process, and ship orders on a timely basis; to account for other product and service transactions with customers; to manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers; and to process payments to suppliers. Certain of our businesses continue to make substantial investments in information systems, including, but not limited to, the new patient support technology ecosystem, Fusion, at ABCS's services business and the implementation of a new ERP system at World Courier, and third party service providers are also responsible for managing a significant portion of our information systems. To the extent our information systems are not successfully implemented or fail, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. Our business and results of operations may also be adversely affected if a third party service provider does not perform satisfactorily, or if the information systems are interrupted or damaged by unforeseen events, including due to the actions of third parties.

Information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks. A failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems, or those of our third party service providers, as a result of cyber attacks or information security breaches could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information or personal data, damage our reputation, increase our costs and/or cause losses. As a result, cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of the controls and processes designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. Although we believe that we have robust information security procedures and other safeguards in place, as cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.

Risks generally associated with data privacy regulation and the international transfer of personal data.

We are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy regulations both in the United States and beyond that regulate the collection, use and transfer of personal data, including particularly the transfer of personal data between or among countries. Many of these foreign data privacy regulations (including the General Data Protection Regulation, which becomes effective in the European Union on May 25, 2018) are more stringent than those in the United States. We may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or other penalties. That or other circumstances related to our collection, use and transfer of personal data could cause a loss of reputation in the market and/or adversely affect our business and financial position.

Our goodwill or intangible assets may become impaired, which would require us to record a significant charge to earnings in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Natural disasters or other unexpected events may disrupt our operations, adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, and may not be covered by insurance.

The occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including fires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, and other forms of severe hazards in the United States or in other countries in which we operate or are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Extreme weather, natural disasters, power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of distribution centers or outsourcing facilities, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products, delay in the delivery of products to our distribution centers, and/or









disruption of our ability to deliver products to customers. Further, the long-term effects of climate change on general economic conditions and the pharmaceutical distribution industry in particular are unclear, and changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy and the regulatory and other costs associated with energy production and delivery may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our businesses. Existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for the costs that may arise from such events, particularly if such events are catastrophic in nature or occur in combination. Any long-term disruption in our ability to service our customers from one or more distribution centers or outsourcing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
