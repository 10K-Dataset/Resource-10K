Item 1A.  Risk Factors

Risk Factors Related to the Retail Industry

Economic and market conditions may adversely affect the retail industry and consequently reduce our revenues and cash flow, and increase our operating expenses.

Our properties are leased primarily to retail tenants from whom we derive most of our revenue in the form of minimum rent, expense recoveries and other income.  Therefore, our performance and operating results are directly linked to the economic and market conditions occurring in the retail industry.  We are subject to the risks, that upon expiration, leases for space in our properties are not renewed by existing tenants, vacant space is not leased to new tenants, or demand new lease terms, including costs for renovations or concessions. The market for leasing retail space in our properties may be adversely affected by any of the following:

•changes in national, regional and local economic conditions;

•deterioration in the competitiveness and creditworthiness of our retail tenants;

•increased competition from the use of e-commerce by retailers and consumers as well as other concepts such as super-stores and warehouse clubs;

•tenant bankruptcies and subsequent rejections of our leases;

•reductions in consumer spending and retail sales;

•reduced tenant demand for retail space;

•oversupply of retail space;

•reduced consumer demand for certain retail categories;

•consolidation within the retail sector;

•increased operating costs;

•perceptions by retailers and shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of our properties;

•casualties, natural disasters and terrorist attacks; and

•armed conflicts against the United States.



To the extent that any of these conditions occur they are likely to impact the retail industry, our retail tenants, the demand and market rents for retail space, the occupancy levels of our properties, our ability to sell, acquire or develop properties, our operating results and our cash available for distributions to stock and unit holders.

The integration of bricks and mortar stores and e-commerce by retailers and a continued shift in retail sales towards e-commerce may adversely impact our revenues and cash flows.

The recent merger of Amazon.com with Whole Foods Market, Inc. highlights the increasing impact of e-commerce on retailers and changes in customer buying habits, including curbside pick-up of items ordered on line and home delivery of food kits, such as Blue Apron and HelloFresh.  Retailers are considering these e-commerce trends when making decisions regarding their bricks and mortar stores and how they will compete and innovate in a rapidly changing e-commerce environment.  Many retailers in our shopping centers provide services or sell goods, which have historically been less likely to be purchased online; however, the continuing increase in e-commerce sales in all retail categories may cause retailers to adjust the size or number of retail locations in the future or close stores.  This shift may adversely impact our occupancy and rental rates, which would impact our revenues and cash flows. Changes in shopping trends as a result of the growth in e-commerce may also impact the profitability of retailers that do not adapt to changes in market conditions.  These conditions may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows if we are unable to meet the needs of our tenants or if our tenants encounter financial difficulties as a result of changing market conditions.

Our business is dependent on perceptions by retailers and shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of our retail properties.

We are dependent on perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of our retail properties. If retailers and shoppers perceive competing retail properties and other retailing options to be safer, more convenient, or of a higher quality, our revenues may be adversely affected.

Changing economic and retail market conditions in geographic areas where our properties are concentrated may reduce our revenues and cash flow.

Economic conditions in markets where our properties are concentrated can greatly influence our financial performance.  During the year endedDecember 31, 2017, our properties in California, Florida, and Texas accounted for30.1%,17.3%, and7.8%, respectively, of our NOI from Consolidated Properties plus our pro-rata share from Unconsolidated










Properties ("pro-rata basis").  Our revenues and cash flow may be adversely affected by this geographic concentration if market conditions, such as supply of or demand for retail space, deteriorate more significantly in California, Florida, or Texas compared to other geographic areas.

Our success depends on the success and continued presence of our “anchor” tenants.

Anchor Tenants ("Anchor Tenants" or "Anchors" occupying 10,000 square feet or more) occupy large stores in our shopping centers, pay a significant portion of the total rent at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by attracting shoppers to the property.We derive significant revenues from anchor tenants such asPublix,Kroger,Albertsons/Safeway,TJX Companies, andWhole Foodswho accounted for3.1%,3.1%,2.9%,2.4%, and2.3%, respectively, of our total annualized base rent on a pro-rata basis, for the year endedDecember 31, 2017.  Our net income and cash flow may be adversely affected by the loss of revenues and additional costs in the event a significant anchor tenant:

•becomes bankrupt or insolvent;

•experiences a downturn in its business;

•materially defaults on its leases;

•does not renew its leases as they expire;

•renews at lower rental rates and/or requires a tenant improvement allowance; or

•renews, but reduces its store size, which results in down-time and additional tenant improvement costs to the landlord to release the vacated space.



Some anchors have the right to vacate their space and may prevent us from re-tenanting by continuing to comply and pay rent in accordance with their lease agreement.  Vacated anchor space, including space owned by the anchor, can reduce rental revenues generated by the shopping center in other spaces because of the loss of the departed anchor's customer drawing power.  If a significant tenant vacates a property, co-tenancy clauses in select centers may allow other tenants to modify or terminate their rent or lease obligations.  Co-tenancy clauses have several variants: they may allow a tenant to postpone a store opening if certain other tenants fail to open their stores; they may allow a tenant to close its store prior to lease expiration if another tenant closes its store prior to lease expiration; or more commonly, they may allow a tenant to pay reduced levels of rent until a certain number of tenants open their stores within the same shopping center.

A significant percentage of our revenues are derived from smaller shop space tenants and our net income may be adversely impacted if our smaller shop tenants are not successful.

A significant percentage of our revenues are derived from smaller shop space tenants ("Shop Space Tenants" occupying less than 10,000 square feet).  Shop Space Tenants may be more vulnerable to negative economic conditions as they have more limited resources than Anchor Tenants.  Shop Space Tenants are facing reductions in sales as a result of an increase in competition including from e-commerce retailers.  Certain Shop Space Tenants are incorporating e-commerce into their business strategies and may seek to reduce their store sizes upon lease expiration as they adjust to and implement alternative distribution channels.  The types of Shop Space Tenants vary from retail shops and restaurants to service providers.  If we are unable to attract the right type or mix of Shop Space Tenants into our centers, our revenues and cash flow may be adversely impacted.

AtDecember 31, 2017, Shop Space Tenants represent approximately36%of our GLA leased at average base rents of$32PSF.  A one-percent decline in our shop space occupancy may result in a reduction to minimum rent of approximately$4.7 million.

We may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy.

Although minimum rent and recoveries from tenants are supported by long-term lease contracts, tenants who file bankruptcy have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores.  Any unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant for unpaid rent might be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims.  As a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold.  Additionally, we may incur significant expense to recover our claim and to release the vacated space.  In the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and rejects its leases, we may experience a significant reduction in our revenues and may not be able to collect all pre-petition amounts owed by the bankrupt tenant.

Risk Factors Related to Real Estate Investments and Operations

We are subject to numerous laws and regulations that may adversely affect our operations or expose us to liability.










Our properties are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations, some of which may conflict with one another or be subject to varying judicial or regulatory interpretations. These laws and regulations may include zoning laws, building codes, competition laws, rules and agreements, landlord-tenant laws, property tax regulations, changes in real estate assessments and other laws and regulations generally applicable to business operations. Noncompliance with such laws and regulations, and any associated litigation may expose us to liability.

Our real estate assets may decline in value and be subject to impairment losses which may reduce our net income.

Our real estate properties are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.  We evaluate whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance and general market conditions, such that the value of the real estate properties (including any related tangible or intangible assets or liabilities and goodwill) may not be recoverable.  Through the evaluation, we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset.  Our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions, including rental rates, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions, anticipated holding periods, and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition, including the exit capitalization rate.  These key assumptions are subjective in nature and may differ materially from actual results.  Changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the holding period of an asset or asset group, which may result in an impairment loss and such loss may be material to the Company's financial condition or operating performance.  To the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value.

The fair value of real estate assets is subjective and is determined through the use of comparable sales information and other market data if available, or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the traditional discounted cash flow approach.  Such cash flow projections take into account expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other relevant criteria, and therefore are subject to management judgment.  Changes in these factors may impact the determination of fair value.  In estimating the fair value of undeveloped land, we generally use market data and comparable sales information.

These subjective assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment charge results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income, which may be material.  There can be no assurance that we will not record impairment charges in the future related to our assets.



We face risks associated with development, redevelopment and expansion of properties.

We actively pursue opportunities for new retail development, or existing property redevelopment or expansion.  Development and redevelopment activities require various government and other approvals for entitlements and any delay in such approvals may significantly delay this process.  We may not recover our investment in development or redevelopment projects for which approvals are not received.  We are subject to other risks associated with these activities, including the following risks:

•we may be unable to lease developments to full occupancy on a timely basis;

•the occupancy rates and rents of a completed project may not be sufficient to make the project profitable;

•actual costs of a project may exceed original estimates, possibly making the project unprofitable;

•delays in the development or construction process may increase our costs;

•we may abandon a development opportunity and lose our investment;

•the size of our development pipeline may strain our labor or capital capacity to complete developments within targeted timelines and may reduce our investment returns;

•a reduction in the demand for new retail space may reduce our future development activities, which in turn may reduce our net operating income;

•changes in the level of future development activity may adversely impact our results from operations by reducing the amount of internal general overhead costs that may be capitalized;

•a shift in our development and acquisition focus to mixed use properties in very dense urban locations (with or without joint venture or development partners for residential or office components), with differing tenant profiles or mixes, and/or multi-story buildings, all in select cases.



We face risks associated with the acquisition of properties.

Our investment strategy includes investing in high-quality shopping centers that are leased to market-dominant grocers, category-leading anchors, specialty retailers, or restaurants located in areas with high barriers to entry and above










average household incomes and population densities.  The acquisition of properties and/or real estate entities entails risks that include, but are not limited to, the following, any of which may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows:

•properties we acquire may fail to achieve the occupancy or rental rates we project, within the time frames we estimate, which may result in the properties' failure to achieve the investment returns we project;

•our investigation of an entity, property or building prior to our acquisition, and any representation we may have received from such seller, may fail to reveal various liabilities including defects and necessary repairs, which may increase our costs;

•our estimate of the costs to improve, reposition or redevelop a property may prove to be too low, or the time we estimate to complete the improvement, repositioning or redevelopment may be too short, either of which may result in the property failing to achieve our projected return, either temporarily or permanently;

•we may not recover our costs from an unsuccessful acquisition;

•our acquisition activities may distract or strain our management capacity; and

•we may not be able to successfully integrate an acquisition into our existing operations platform.



We face risks if we expand into new markets.

If opportunities arise, we may acquire or develop properties in markets where we currently have no presence.  Each of the risks applicable to acquiring or developing properties in our current markets are applicable to acquiring, developing and integrating properties in new markets.  In addition, we may not possess the same level of familiarity with the dynamics and conditions of the new markets we may enter, which may adversely affect our operating results and investment returns in those markets.

We may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid.

Our properties, including their related tangible and intangible assets, represent the majority of our total consolidated assets and they are relatively illiquid. As a result, our ability to sell one or more of our properties including properties held in joint venture in response to changes in economic, industry, or other conditions may be limited. The real estate market is affected by many factors, such as general economic conditions, availability and terms of financing, interest rates and other factors, including supply and demand for space, that are beyond our control.  There may be less demand for lower quality properties that we have identified for ultimate disposition in markets with uncertain economic or retail environments, and where buyers are more reliant on the availability of third party mortgage financing.  If we want to sell a property, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or at all or that the sales price of a property will be attractive at the relevant time or even exceed the carrying value of our investment.  Moreover, if a property is mortgaged, we may not be able to obtain a release of the lien on that property without the payment of a substantial prepayment penalty, which may restrict our ability to dispose of the property, even though the sale might otherwise be desirable.

Certain properties we own have a low tax basis, which may result in a taxable gain on sale.  We intend to utilize 1031 exchanges to mitigate taxable income; however, there can be no assurance that we will identify properties that meet our investment objectives for acquisitions.  In the event that we do not utilize 1031 exchanges, we may be required to distribute the gain proceeds to shareholders or pay income tax, which may reduce our cash flow available to fund our commitments.

Certain of the properties in our portfolio are subject to ground leases; if we are found to be in breach of a ground lease or are unable to renew a ground lease, we may be materially and adversely affected.

We have28properties in our portfolio that are either partially or completely on land subject to ground leases with third parties.  Accordingly, we only own a long-term leasehold or similar interest in those properties.  If we are found to be in breach of a ground lease, we may lose our interest in the improvements and the right to operate the property that is subject to the ground lease.  In addition, unless we can purchase a fee interest in the underlying land or extend the terms of these leases before or upon their expiration, as to which no assurance can be given, we will lose our interest in the improvements and the right to operate such properties.  The existing lease terms, including renewal options, were taken into consideration when making our investment decisions.  The purchase price and subsequent improvements are being depreciated over the shorter of the remaining life of the ground leases or the useful life of the underlying assets.  If we were to lose the right to operate a property due to a breach or not exercising renewal options of the ground lease, we would be unable to derive income from such property, which would impair the value of our investments, and materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Geographic concentration of our properties makes our business vulnerable to natural disasters, severe weather conditions and climate change.  An uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the insurance coverage on our properties may subject us to loss of capital and revenue on those properties.










A significant number of our properties are located in areas that are susceptible to earthquakes, tropical storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, sea-level rise, and other natural disasters.  As ofDecember 31, 2017, 26% of the total insured value of our portfolio is located in the state of California, including a number of properties in the San Francisco Bay and Los Angeles areas.  Additionally, 18% and 7% of the total insured value of our portfolio is located in the states of Florida and Texas, respectively.  Recent intense weather conditions may cause property insurance premiums to increase significantly in the future.  We recognize that the frequency and / or intensity of extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and other climatic changes may continue to increase, and as a result, our exposure to these events may increase.  These weather conditions may disrupt our business and the business of our tenants, which may affect the ability of some tenants to pay rent and may reduce the willingness of tenants or residents to remain in or move to these affected areas.  Therefore, as a result of the geographic concentration of our properties, we face risks, including higher costs, such as uninsured property losses and higher insurance premiums, and disruptions to our business and the businesses of our tenants.

We carry comprehensive liability, fire, flood, terrorism, rental loss, and environmental insurance for our properties with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties.  Some types of losses, such as losses from named wind storms, earthquakes, terrorism, or wars may have limited coverage or be excluded from insurance coverage.  Although we carry specific insurance coverage for named windstorm and earthquake losses, the policies are subject to deductibles up to 2% to 5% of the total insured value of each property, up to a $10 million maximum deductible per occurrence for each of these perils, with limits of $300 million per occurrence for all perils except earthquake, which has a total annual aggregate limit of $300 million.  Terrorism coverage is limited to $200 million per occurrence related to property damage.  Liability claims are limited to $151 million per occurrence.  Should a loss occur at any of our properties that is subject to a substantial deductible or is in excess of the property or casualty insurance limits of our policies, we may lose part or all of our invested capital and revenues from such property, which may have a material adverse impact on our operating results, financial condition, and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders.

To the extent climate change causes adverse changes in weather patterns, our properties in certain markets may experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea‑levels. Over time, these conditions may result in volatile or decreased demand for retail space at certain of our properties or, in extreme cases, our inability to operate the properties at all. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of insurance on favorable terms, or making insurance unavailable. Moreover, compliance with new laws or regulations related to climate change, including compliance with “green” building codes, may require us to make improvements to our existing properties or increase taxes and fees assessed on us or our properties. At this time, there can be no assurance that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on us.

Terrorist activities or violence occurring at our properties also may directly affect the value of our properties through damage, destruction or loss. Insurance for such acts may be unavailable or cost more resulting in an increase to our operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations. To the extent that our tenants are affected by such attacks and threats of attacks, their businesses may be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to meet obligations under their existing leases.

Loss of our key personnel may adversely affect our business and operations.

The success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees, and our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees may significantly impact our future performance. Competition for these individuals is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our executive management team and other key employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals for these positions in the future. Losing any one or more of these persons may have a material adverse effect on us.

We face competition from numerous sources, including other REITs and other real estate owners.

The ownership of shopping centers is highly fragmented.  We face competition from other public REITs, large private investors, institutional investors, and from numerous small owners in the acquisition, ownership, and leasing of shopping centers.  We also compete to develop shopping centers with other REITs engaged in development activities as well as with local, regional, and national real estate developers.  This competition may:

•reduce the number of properties available for acquisition or development;

•increase the cost of properties available for acquisition or development; and

•hinder our ability to attract and retain tenants, leading to increased vacancy rates and/or reduced rents.



If we cannot successfully compete in our targeted markets, our cash flow, and therefore distributions to stock and unit holders, may be adversely affected.










Costs of environmental remediation may reduce our cash flow available for distribution to stock and unit holders.

Under various federal, state, and local laws, an owner or manager of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on the property.  These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances.  The cost of any required remediation may exceed the value of the property and/or the aggregate assets of the owner or the responsible party. The presence of, or the failure to properly remediate, hazardous or toxic substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a contaminated property or to use the property as collateral for a loan.  We can provide no assurance that we are aware of all potential environmental liabilities; that any previous owner, occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us; that our properties will not be affected by tenants or nearby properties or other unrelated third parties; and that future uses or conditions, or changes in environmental laws and regulations will not result in additional material environmental liabilities to us.

Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and fire, safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures.

All of our properties are required to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), which generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities.  Compliance with ADA requirements may require removal of access barriers, and noncompliance may result in imposition of fines by the U.S. government or an award of damages to private litigants, or both.  While the tenants to whom we lease space in our properties are obligated by law to comply with the ADA provisions, and typically under tenant leases are obligated to cover costs associated with compliance, if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated, or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, the ability of these tenants to cover costs may be adversely affected.  In addition, we are required to operate the properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations, as they may be adopted by governmental entities and become applicable to the properties.  We may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with these requirements, and these expenditures may have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our financial obligations and make distributions to our stock and unit holders.

We face risks associated with security breaches through cyber‑attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology (IT) networks and related systems.

We face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber‑attacks or cyber intrusions over the internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e‑mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems, and other significant disruptions of our IT networks and related systems. Our IT networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day‑to‑day operations and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants and co-investment partners. Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.

A breach or significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our systems, including our primary website, may damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers, tenants and revenues, generate third party claims, result in the unintended and/or unauthorized public disclosure or the misappropriation of proprietary, personal identifying and confidential information, and require us to incur significant expenses to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues, and we may not be able to recover these expenses in whole or in any part from our service providers, responsible parties, or insurance carriers.

Risk Factors Related to Our Partnerships and Joint Ventures

We do not have voting control over properties owned in our co-investment partnerships and joint ventures, so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued.

We have invested substantial capital as a partner in a number of partnerships and joint ventures to acquire, own, lease, develop or redevelop properties.  These activities are subject to the same risks as our investments in our wholly-owned properties.  These investments, and other future similar investments may involve risks that would not be present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that partners or other owners might become bankrupt, suffer a deterioration in their creditworthiness, or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. Partners or other owners may have economic or










other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our own business interests or goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives.

These investments, and other future similar investments, also have the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions, such as a sale or financing, because neither we nor our partner or other owner has full control over the partnership or joint venture. Disputes between us and partners or other owners might result in litigation or arbitration that may increase our expenses and prevent management from focusing their time and efforts on our business. Consequently, actions by, or disputes with, partners or other owners might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk. In addition, we risk the possibility of being liable for the actions of our partners or other owners.  These factors may limit the return that we receive from such investments or cause our cash flows to be lower than our estimates.

The termination of our partnerships may adversely affect our cash flow, operating results, and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders.

If partnerships owning a significant number of properties were dissolved for any reason, we would lose the asset, property management, leasing and construction management fees from these partnerships, which may adversely affect our operating results and our cash available for distribution to stock and unit holders.

Risk Factors Related to Funding Strategies and Capital Structure

Higher market capitalization rates and lower net operating income ("NOI") at our properties may adversely impact our ability to sell properties and fund developments and acquisitions, and may dilute earnings.

As part of our funding strategy, we sell operating properties that no longer meet our investment standards or those with a limited future growth profile.  These sales proceeds are used to fund the construction of new developments, redevelopments, and repay debt and acquisitions.  An increase in market capitalization rates or a decline in NOI may cause a reduction in the value of centers identified for sale, which would have an adverse impact on the amount of cash generated.  In order to meet the cash requirements of our development program, we may be required to sell more properties than initially planned, which may have a negative impact on our earnings.  Additionally, the sale of properties resulting in significant tax gains may require higher distributions to our stockholders or payment of additional income taxes in order to maintain our REIT status.  We intend to utilize 1031 exchanges to mitigate taxable income, however there can be no assurance that we will identify properties that meet our investment objectives for acquisitions.

We depend on external sources of capital, which may not be available in the future on favorable terms or at all.

To qualify as a REIT, the Parent Company must, among other things, distribute to its stockholders each year at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (excluding any net capital gains).  Because of these distribution requirements, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs with income from operations.  We therefore will have to rely on third-party sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all.  Our access to third-party sources of capital depends on a number of things, including the market's perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings.  Our access to debt depends on our credit rating, the willingness of creditors to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets.  In addition to finding creditors willing to lend to us, we are dependent upon our joint venture partners to contribute their pro rata share of any amount needed to repay or refinance existing debt when lenders reduce the amount of debt our partnerships and joint ventures are eligible to refinance.

In addition, our existing debt arrangements also impose covenants that limit our flexibility in obtaining other financing.  Additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders' interests and additional debt financing may substantially increase our degree of leverage.

Without access to external sources of capital, we would be required to pay outstanding debt with our operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales.  Our operating cash flows may not be sufficient to pay our outstanding debt as it comes due and real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly at a return we believe is appropriate.  If we are required to deleverage our business with operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales, we may be forced to reduce the amount of, or eliminate altogether, our distributions to stock and unit holders or refrain from making investments in our business.

Our debt financing may adversely affect our business and financial condition.

Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance, which to a certain extent is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control.  In addition, we do not expect to generate sufficient operating cash flow to make balloon principal payments on our debt when due.  If we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms, we may be forced (i) to dispose of properties, which might result in losses, or (ii) to obtain financing at unfavorable terms, either of which may reduce the cash flow available for distributions to










stock and unit holders.  If we cannot make required mortgage payments, the mortgagee may foreclose on the property securing the mortgage.

Covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition.

Our unsecured notes, unsecured term loans, and unsecured line of credit contain customary covenants, including compliance with financial ratios, such as ratio of total debt to gross asset value and fixed charge coverage ratio.  Fixed charge coverage ratio is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") divided by the sum of interest expense and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders, if any.  These covenants may limit our operational flexibility and our acquisition activities.  Moreover, if we breach any of the covenants in our debt agreements, and do not cure the breach within the applicable cure period, our lenders may require us to repay the debt immediately, even in the absence of a payment default.  Many of our debt arrangements, including our unsecured notes, unsecured term loans, and unsecured line of credit are cross-defaulted, which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other material debt obligations.  As a result, any default under our debt covenants may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, our results of operations, our ability to meet our obligations, and the market value of our stock.

Increases in interest rates would cause our borrowing costs to rise and negatively impact our results of operations.

Although a significant amount of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, we do borrow funds at variable interest rates under our credit facilities and term loans.  As ofDecember 31, 2017,2.7%of our outstanding debt was variable rate debt.  Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense on any variable rate debt to the extent we have not hedged our exposure to changes in interest rates.  In addition, increases in interest rates will affect the terms under which we refinance our existing debt as it matures, to the extent we have not hedged our exposure to changes in interest rates.  This would reduce our future earnings and cash flows, which may adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also may reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our stock and unit holders.

Hedging activity may expose us to risks, including the risks that a counterparty will not perform and that the hedge will not yield the economic benefits we anticipate, which may adversely affect us.

From time to time, we manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements that involve risk, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, and that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes.  There can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will qualify for hedge accounting or that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations.  Should we desire to terminate a hedging agreement, there may be significant costs and cash requirements involved to fulfill our obligations under the hedging agreement.  Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations.

We may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax-deferred contribution transactions, which may result in stockholder dilution and limit our ability to sell such assets.

We may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in our operating partnership, which may result in stockholder dilution.  This acquisition structure may have the effect of, among other things, reducing the amount of tax depreciation we may deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties, and may require that we agree to protect the contributors’ ability to defer recognition of taxable gain through restrictions on our ability to dispose of the acquired properties and/or the allocation of partnership debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases.  These restrictions may limit our ability to sell an asset at a time, or on terms, that would be favorable absent such restrictions.

Risk Factors Related to our Company and the Market Price for Our Securities

As a result of our merger with Equity One, Inc., the Gazit Parties became significant stockholders of Regency Centers and may have interests that are different from our other stockholders.

Mr. Chaim Katzman and Gazit-Globe, Ltd. and certain of its affiliated entities ("the Gazit Parties") own less than 10% of outstanding shares of our common stock.  This concentration of ownership in one group of stockholders may potentially be disadvantageous to the interests of our other stockholders.  The Gazit Parties have sold some of the shares they own in Regency Centers since we merged, and have filed a plan with the SEC to continue selling shares.  Continued sales of our shares may cause volatility in our stock price, and we may find it more expensive to raise capital, if needed, through the sale of additional equity securities.










Under the governance agreement entered into as a part of the merger with Equity One, we nominated Mr. Katzman to our board of directors.  Effective February 14, 2018, Mr. Katzman resigned from our board.  However, so long as the Gazit Parties beneficially own 7% or more of our outstanding common stock, the Gazit Parties will have the right to designate another person to be appointed to our board of directors, which person must be reasonably acceptable to our board of directors.

Changes in economic and market conditions may adversely affect the market price of our securities.

The market price of our debt and equity securities may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, many of which are out of our control, including:

•actual or anticipated variations in our operating results;

•changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates;

•publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry in general and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our securities or those of other REIT's;

•the ability of our tenants to pay rent and meet their other obligations to us under current lease terms and our ability to re-lease space as leases expire;

•increases in market interest rates that drive purchasers of our stock to demand a higher dividend yield;

•changes in market valuations of similar companies;

•adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future;

•any future issuances of equity securities;

•additions or departures of key management personnel;

•strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;

•actions by institutional stockholders;

•changes in our dividend payments;

•potential tax law changes on REITs;

•speculation in the press or investment community; and

•general market and economic conditions.



These factors may cause the market price of our securities to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects.  It is impossible to ensure that the market price of our securities, including our common stock, will not fall in the future.  A decrease in the market price of our common stock may reduce our ability to raise additional equity in the public markets.  Selling common stock at a decreased market price would have a dilutive impact on existing stockholders.

There is no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates.

Our ability to continue to pay dividends at historical rates or to increase our dividend rate will depend on a number of factors, including, among others, the following:

•our financial condition and results of future operations;

•the terms of our loan covenants; and

•our ability to acquire, finance, develop or redevelop and lease additional properties at attractive rates.



If we do not maintain or periodically increase the dividend on our common stock, it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and other securities.



Risk Factors Related to Laws and Regulations

If the Parent Company fails to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, it would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates.

We believe that the Parent Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, and we plan to operate so that we can continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT.  If the Parent Company continues to qualify as a REIT, it generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders.  Many REIT requirements, however, are highly technical and complex.  The determination that the Parent Company is a REIT requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances, some of which may not be totally within our control and some of which involve questions of interpretation.  For example, to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income must come from specific passive sources, like rent, that are itemized in the REIT tax laws.  There can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or a court would agree with the positions we have taken in interpreting the REIT requirements.  We are also










required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, excluding capital gains.  The fact that we hold many of our assets through co-investment partnerships and their subsidiaries further complicates the application of the REIT requirements.  Furthermore, Congress and the IRS might make changes to the tax laws and regulations, and the courts might issue new rulings, that make it more difficult, or impossible, for the Parent Company to remain qualified as a REIT.

Also, unless the IRS granted relief under certain statutory provisions, the Parent Company would remain disqualified as a REIT for four years following the year it first failed to qualify.  If the Parent Company failed to qualify as a REIT (currently and/or with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired), we would have to pay significant income taxes, reducing cash available to pay dividends, which would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities.  In addition, we would no longer be required to pay any dividends to stockholders.  Although we believe that the Parent Company qualifies as a REIT, we cannot assure you that the Parent Company will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT for tax purposes.

Even if the Parent Company qualifies as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we are required to pay certain federal, state, and local taxes on our income and property.  For example, if we have net income from “prohibited transactions,” that income will be subject to a 100% tax.  In general, prohibited transactions include sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business.  The determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale.  While we have undertaken a significant number of asset sales in recent years, we do not believe that those sales should be considered prohibited transactions, but there can be no assurance that the IRS would not contend otherwise.

In addition, on December 22, 2017, H.R. 1, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act") was signed into law by the U.S. President. Although we are not aware of any provision in the final tax reform legislation or any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect our ability to operate as a REIT, new legislation, as well as new regulations, administrative interpretations, or court decisions may be introduced, enacted, or promulgated from time to time, that may change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a REIT, or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification, in a manner that is adverse to our stockholders.



Recent changes to the U.S. tax laws may have a significant negative impact on the overall economy, our tenants, our investors, and our business.



The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act made significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").  While the changes in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act generally appear to be favorable with respect to REITs, the extensive changes to non-REIT provisions in the Code may have unanticipated effects on us or our stockholders. Moreover, Congressional leaders have recognized that the process of adopting extensive tax legislation in a short amount of time without hearings and substantial time for review is likely to have led to drafting errors, issues needing clarification and unintended consequences that will have to be reviewed in subsequent tax legislation. At this point, it is not clear when Congress will address these issues or when the Internal Revenue Service will issue administrative guidance on the changes made in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.



As a result of the changes to U.S. federal tax laws implemented by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our taxable income and the amount of distributions to our stockholders required in order to maintain our REIT status, and our relative tax advantage as a REIT, may significantly change. The long-term impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on the overall economy, government revenues, our tenants, us, and the real estate industry cannot be reliably predicted at this early stage of the new law’s implementation. Furthermore, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may negatively impact certain of our tenants’ operating results, financial condition, and future business plans. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may also result in reduced government revenues, and therefore reduced government spending, which may negatively impact some of our tenants that rely on government funding. There can be no assurance that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will not negatively impact our operating results, financial condition, and future business operations.



Dividends paid by REITs generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates.

Subject to limited exceptions, dividends paid by REITs (other than distributions designated as capital gain dividends, qualified dividends or returns of capital) are not eligible for reduced rates for qualified dividends paid by "C" corporations and are taxable at ordinary income tax rates.  The more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends may cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which may adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including the shares of our capital stock.

Under the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the rate brackets for non-corporate taxpayer’s ordinary income are adjusted, the top tax rate is reduced from 39.6% to 37% (excluding the 3.8% Medicare tax on net investment income), and










ordinary REIT dividends are taxed at even lower effective rates. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, distributions from REITs that are treated as dividends but are not designated as qualified dividends or capital gain dividends are generally taxed as ordinary income after deducting 20% of the amount of the dividend in the case of non-corporate stockholders. At the maximum ordinary income tax rate of 37% applicable for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, the maximum tax rate on ordinary REIT dividends for non-corporate stockholders is generally 29.6% (plus the 3.8% Medicare tax on net investment income).

Foreign stockholders may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on gain recognized on a disposition of our common stock if we do not qualify as a "domestically controlled" REIT.

A foreign person disposing of a U.S. real property interest, including shares of a U.S. corporation whose assets consist principally of U.S. real property interests is generally subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized on the disposition.  This tax does not apply, however, to the disposition of stock in a REIT if the REIT is "domestically controlled."  In general, we will be a domestically controlled REIT if at all times during the five-year period ending on the applicable stockholder’s disposition of our stock, less than 50% in value of our stock was held directly or indirectly by non-U.S. persons. If we were to fail to qualify as a domestically controlled REIT, gain recognized by a foreign stockholder on a disposition of our common stock would be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless our common stock was traded on an established securities market and the foreign stockholder did not at any time during a specified testing period directly or indirectly own more than 10% of our outstanding common stock.

Legislative or other actions affecting REITs may have a negative effect on us.

The rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Changes to the tax laws, with or without retroactive application, may adversely affect Regency or our investors.  We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect Regency or our investors. New legislation, Treasury Regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification, or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us.  Also, the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities, or an investment in other entities, may change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a REIT.

Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.

The REIT provisions of the Code limit our ability to hedge our liabilities. Generally, income from a hedging transaction that constitutes “qualifying income” for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests applicable to REITs, does not constitute “gross income” for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests, provided that we properly identify the hedging transaction pursuant to the applicable sections of the Code and Treasury Regulations.  To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, or fail to make the proper tax identifications, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both gross income tests. As a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of otherwise advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS.

Changes in accounting standards may impact our financial results.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"), in conjunction with the SEC, has several key projects recently completed or on their agenda that may impact how we currently account for our material transactions, including lease accounting and other convergence projects with the International Accounting Standards Board.  The largest projects, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and Leases, have been issued and will be adopted by the Company by their effective dates, as further described in note 1.  The Leases standard is expected to have an impact on our financial statements when adopted to require all of our operating leases for office, ground and equipment leases to be recorded on our balance sheet.  Also, we will no longer capitalize internal leasing compensation costs and legal costs associated with leasing activities under the new standard, which will result in an increase in our general and administrative costs and a reduction to our net income.

Restrictions on the ownership of the Parent Company's capital stock to preserve its REIT status may delay or prevent a change in control.

Ownership of more than 7% by value of our outstanding capital stock is prohibited, with certain exceptions, by the Parent Company's articles of incorporation, for the purpose of maintaining its qualification as a REIT.  This 7% limitation may discourage a change in control and may also (i) deter tender offers for our capital stock, which offers may be attractive to our stockholders, or (ii) limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their capital stock that might otherwise exist if an investor attempted to assemble a block in excess of 7% of our outstanding capital stock or to affect a change in control.










The issuance of the Parent Company's capital stock may delay or prevent a change in control.

The Parent Company's articles of incorporation authorize our Board of Directors to issue up to 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock and 10,000,000 shares of special common stock and to establish the preferences and rights of any shares issued.  The issuance of preferred stock or special common stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control.  The provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act regarding affiliated transactions may also deter potential acquisitions by preventing the acquiring party from consummating a merger or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of our disinterested stockholders.
