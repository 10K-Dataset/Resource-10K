Item 1A.Risk Factors



We are a holding company that conducts all of our business operations through subsidiaries, primarily Houston Electric and CERC. We also own interests in Enable. The following, along with any additional legal proceedings identified or incorporated by reference in Item 3 of this report, summarizes the principal risk factors associated with the businesses conducted by our subsidiaries and our interests in Enable:



Risk Factors Associated with Our Consolidated Financial Condition



As a holding company with no operations of our own, we will depend on distributions from our subsidiaries and from Enable to meet our payment obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock, and provisions of applicable law or contractual restrictions could limit the amount of those distributions.



We derive all of our operating income from, and hold all of our assets through, our subsidiaries, including our interests in Enable. As a result, we depend on distributions from our subsidiaries and Enable to meet our payment obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock. In general, our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide us with funds for our payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or otherwise. In addition, provisions of applicable law, such as those limiting the legal sources of dividends, limit our subsidiaries’ ability to make payments or other distributions to us, and our subsidiaries could agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make distributions.  For a discussion










of risks that may impact the amount of cash distributions we receive with respect to our interests in Enable, please read “ — Additional Risk Factors Affecting Our Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LP — Our cash flows will be adversely impacted if we receive less cash distributions from Enable than we currently expect.”



Our right to receive any assets of any subsidiary, and therefore the right of our creditors to participate in those assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors. In addition, even if we were a creditor of any subsidiary, our rights as a creditor would be subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness of the subsidiary senior to that held by us.



If we are unable to arrange future financings on acceptable terms, our ability torefinance existing indebtedness could be limited.



Our businesses are capital intensive in nature. We depend on long-term debt to finance a portion of our capital expenditures and refinance our existing debt and on short-term borrowings through our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper programs to satisfy liquidity needs to the extent not satisfied by cash flow from our business operations. As of December 31, 2016, we had $8.6 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, which includes $2.3 billion of non-recourse Securitization Bonds. As of December 31, 2016, approximately $850 million principal amount of this debt is required to be paid through 2019. This amount excludes principal repayments of approximately $1.3 billion on Securitization Bonds, for which dedicated revenue streams exist. Our future financing activities may be significantly affected by, among other things:



•general economic and capital market conditions;



•credit availability from financial institutions and other lenders;



•volatility or fluctuations in distributions from Enable’s units or volatility in Enable’s unit price;



•investor confidence in us and the markets in which we operate;



•maintenance of acceptable credit ratings;



•market expectations regarding our future earnings and cash flows;



•our ability to access capital markets on reasonable terms;



•our exposure to GenOn (formerly known as RRI Energy, Inc., Reliant Energy and RRI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of NRG, in connection with certain indemnification obligations;



•incremental collateral that may be required due to regulation of derivatives; and



•provisions of relevant tax and securities laws.



As of December 31, 2016, Houston Electric had approximately $2.6 billion aggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds outstanding under the General Mortgage, including approximately $118 million held in trust to secure pollution control bonds for which we are obligated.  Additionally, as of December 31, 2016, Houston Electric had approximately $102 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds outstanding under the Mortgage. Houston Electric may issue additional general mortgage bonds on the basis of retired bonds, 70% of property additions or cash deposited with the trustee. Approximately $4.1 billion of additional first mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds in the aggregate could be issued on the basis of retired bonds and 70% of property additions as of December 31, 2016. However, Houston Electric has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds, subject to certain exceptions.



Our current credit ratings are discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Other Matters — Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings” in Item 7 of Part II of this report. These credit ratings may not remain in effect for any given period of time and one or more of these ratings may be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to access capital on acceptable terms.












An impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets, including intangible assets, and equity and cost method investments could reduce our earnings.



Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price of a business exceeds the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require us to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired.  Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.



For investments we account for under the equity or cost method, the impairment test considers whether the fair value of such investment as a whole, not the underlying net assets, has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we determined that an other than temporary decrease in the value of our equity investment in Enable had occurred.  This determination was based on the sustained low Enable common unit price and further declines in such price during the year, as well as the market outlook for continued depressed crude oil and natural gas prices impacting the midstream oil and gas industry.  We wrote down the value of our investment in Enable to its estimated fair value which resulted in impairment charges of $1,225 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Additionally, we recorded our share, $621 million, of impairment charges Enable recorded for goodwill and long-lived assets, for a total impairment charge of $1,846 million.



If Enable’s unit price, distributions or earnings were to decline to levels below those used in our impairment tests in 2015, and that decline is deemed to be other than temporary, we could determine that we are unable to recover the carrying value of our equity investment in Enable. Considerable judgment is used in determining if an impairment loss is other than temporary and the amount of any impairment. A sustained low Enable common unit price could result in our recording further impairment charges in the future. If we determine that an impairment is indicated, we would be required to take an immediate non-cash charge to earnings with a correlative effect on equity and balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization.



Poor investment performance of the pension plan, factors adversely affecting the calculation of pension liabilities and increasing health care costs could unfavorably impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial position.



We maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees. Our costs of providing this plan are dependent upon a number of factors including the investment returns on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to calculate the funded status of the plan, our contributions to the plan and government regulations with respect to funding requirements and the calculation of plan liabilities. Funding requirements may increase and we may be required to make unplanned contributions in the event of a decline in the market value of plan assets, a decline in the interest rates used to calculate the present value of future plan obligations or government regulations that increase minimum funding requirements or the pension liability. In addition to affecting our funding requirements, each of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial position. Further, increasing health care costs and the effects of health care reform or any future legislative changes could also materially affect our benefit programs and costs. Our costs of providing employee benefits and related funding requirements could also increase materially in the future should there be a material reduction in the amount of the recovery of these costs through our rates or should significant delays develop in the timing of the recovery of such costs, which could adversely affect our financial results.



The use of derivative contracts in the normal course of business by us, our subsidiaries or Enable could result in financial losses that could negatively impact our results of operations and those of our subsidiaries or Enable.



We and our subsidiaries use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, to manage our commodity, weather and financial market risks. Enable may also use such instruments from time to time to manage its commodity and financial market risk. We, our subsidiaries or Enable could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values or ineffectiveness of these contracts or should a counterparty fail to perform. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management’s judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.



Risk Factors Affecting Our Electric Transmission & Distribution Business



Rate regulation of Houston Electric’s business may delay or deny Houston Electric’s ability to earn a reasonable return and fully recover its costs.



Houston Electric’s rates are regulated by certain municipalities and the PUCT based on an analysis of its invested capital, its expenses and other factors in a test year in comprehensive base rate proceedings, subject to periodic review and adjustment using










mechanisms like those discussed below. Each of these rate proceedings is subject to third-party intervention and appeal, and the timing of a general base rate proceeding may be out of Houston Electric’s control. The rates that Houston Electric is allowed to charge may not match its costs at any given time, which is referred to as “regulatory lag.”



Though several interim adjustment mechanisms have been implemented to reduce the effects of regulatory lag, such adjustment mechanisms are subject to the applicable regulatory body’s approval and are subject to limitations that may reduce Houston Electric’s ability to adjust rates. For example, the DCRF mechanism adjusts an electric utility’s rates for increases in net distribution-invested capital (e.g., distribution plant and intangible plant and communication equipment) since its last comprehensive base rate proceeding, but Houston Electric may make a DCRF filing only once per year and up to four times between comprehensive rate proceedings. The TCOS mechanism allows a transmission service provider to update its wholesale transmission rates to reflect changes in transmission-related invested capital, but is only available twice a year.



Houston Electric can make no assurance that filings for such mechanisms will result in favorable adjustments to rates.  Further, the regulatory process by which rates are determined is subject to change as a result of the legislative process or rulemaking, as the case may be, and may not always be available or result in rates that will produce recovery of Houston Electric’s costs or enable Houston Electric to earn a reasonable return. In addition, changes to the interim adjustment mechanisms could result in an increase in regulatory lag or otherwise impact Houston Electric’s ability to recover its costs in a timely manner. To the extent the regulatory process does not allow Houston Electric to make a full and timely recovery of appropriate costs, its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.



Disruptions at power generation facilities owned by third parties could interrupt Houston Electric’s sales of transmission and distribution services.



Houston Electric transmits and distributes to customers of REPs electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties. Houston Electric does not own or operate any power generation facilities. If power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate, Houston Electric’s sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted, and its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.



Houston Electric’s revenues and results of operations are seasonal.



A significant portion of Houston Electric’s revenues is derived from rates that it collects from each REP based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of such REP. Thus, Houston Electric’s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage, with revenues generally being higher during the warmer months. Unusually mild weather in the warmer months could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition. Conversely, extreme warm weather conditions could increase our results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring.



The AMS deployed throughout Houston Electric’s service territory may experience unexpected problems with respect to the timely receipt of accurate metering data.



Houston Electric has deployed an AMS throughout its service territory.  The deployment consisted, among other elements, of replacing existing meters with new electronic meters that record metering data at 15-minute intervals and wirelessly communicate that information to Houston Electric over a bi-directional communications system installed for that purpose. The AMS integrates equipment and computer software from various vendors to eliminate the need for physical meter readings to be taken at consumers’ premises, such as monthly readings for billing purposes and special readings associated with a customer’s change in REPs or the connection or disconnection of electric service.  Unanticipated difficulties could be encountered during the operation of the AMS, including failures or inadequacy of equipment or software, difficulties in integrating the various components of the AMS, changes in technology, cyber-security issues and factors outside the control of Houston Electric, which could result in delayed or inaccurate metering data that might lead to delays or inaccuracies in the calculation and imposition of delivery or other charges, which could have a material adverse effect on Houston Electric’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.



Houston Electric could be subject to higher costs and fines or other sanctions as a result of mandatory reliability standards.



The FERC has jurisdiction with respect to ensuring the reliability of electric transmission service, including transmission facilities owned by Houston Electric and other utilities within ERCOT. The FERC has designated the NERC as the ERO to promulgate standards, under FERC oversight, for all owners, operators and users of the bulk power system. The FERC has approved the delegation by the NERC of authority for reliability in ERCOT to the TRE, a functionally independent division of ERCOT.  Compliance with the mandatory reliability standards may subject Houston Electric to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures.  In addition, if Houston Electric were to be found to be in noncompliance with applicable mandatory reliability standards, it could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties.












A substantial portion of Houston Electric’s receivables is concentrated in a small number of REPs, and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect Houston Electric’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.





Risk Factors Affecting Our Natural Gas Distribution and Energy Services Businesses



Rate regulation of CERC’s business may delay or deny CERC’s ability to earn a reasonable return and fully recover its costs.



CERC’s rates for NGD are regulated by certain municipalities (in Texas only) and state commissions in the context of comprehensive base rate proceedings, i.e., general rate cases, based on an analysis of NGD’s invested capital, expenses and other factors in a test year (often either fully or partially historic), subject to periodic review and adjustment. A general rate case is also a very complex and resource intensive proceeding with a relatively long timeline for completion. Thus, the rates that CERC is allowed to charge may not match its costs at any given time, resulting in what is referred to as “regulatory lag.”



Though several interim rate adjustment mechanisms have been approved by jurisdictional regulatory authorities and implemented by NGD to reduce the effects of regulatory lag, such adjustment mechanisms are subject to the applicable regulatory body’s approval and are subject to certain limitations that may reduce NGD’s ability to adjust its rates.



Arkansas enacted legislation in 2015 allowing public utilities to elect to have their rates regulated pursuant to a FRP, but such legislation provides for a utility’s base rates to be adjusted once a year.  In each of Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma, NGD makes annual filings utilizing various formula rate mechanisms that adjust rates based on a comparison of authorized return to actual return to achieve the allowed return rates in those jurisdictions.  Additionally, in Minnesota, the MPUC implemented a full revenue decoupling pilot program in 2015, which separates approved revenues from the amount of natural gas used by its customers. The effectiveness of these filings and programs depends on the approval of the applicable state regulatory body.



In Texas, NGD’s Houston, South Texas, Beaumont/East Texas and Texas Coast divisions each submit annual GRIP filings to recover the incremental capital investments made in the preceding year. NGD must file a general rate case no later than five years after the initial GRIP implementation date.



NGD can make no assurances that such filings will result in favorable adjustments to its rates.  Notwithstanding the application of the rate mechanisms discussed above, the regulatory process in which rates are determined may not always result in rates that will produce full recovery of NGD’s costs and enable NGD to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital.   Additionally, inherent in the regulatory process is some level of risk that jurisdictional regulatory authorities may initiate investigations of the prudence of operating expenses incurred or capital investments made by NGD and deny the full recovery of NGD’s cost of service or the full recovery of incurred natural gas costs in rates. To the extent the regulatory process does not allow NGD to make a full and timely recovery of appropriate costs, its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.












CERC’s natural gas distribution and energy services businesses, including transportation and storage, are subject to fluctuations in notional natural gas prices as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials, which could affect the ability of CERC’s suppliers and customers to meet their obligations or otherwise adversely affect CERC’s liquidity and results of operations and financial condition.



CERC is subject to risk associated with changes in the notional price of natural gas as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials. Increases in natural gas prices might affect CERC’s ability to collect balances due from its customers and, for NGD, could create the potential for uncollectible accounts expense to exceed the recoverable levels built into CERC’s tariff rates. In addition, a sustained period of high natural gas prices could (i) decrease demand for natural gas in the areas in which CERC operates, thereby resulting in decreased sales and revenues and (ii) increase the risk that CERC’s suppliers or customers fail or are unable to meet their obligations. An increase in natural gas prices would also increase CERC’s working capital requirements by increasing the investment that must be made in order to maintain natural gas inventory levels. Additionally, a decrease in natural gas prices could increase the amount of collateral that CERC must provide under its hedging arrangements.



A decline in CERC’s credit rating could result in CERC having to provide collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or to purchase natural gas.



If CERC’s credit rating were to decline, it might be required to post cash collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or to purchase natural gas. If a credit rating downgrade and the resultant cash collateral requirement were to occur at a time when CERC was experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity, CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.



CERC’s revenues and results of operations are seasonal.



A substantial portion of CERC’s revenues is derived from natural gas sales. Thus, CERC’s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in natural gas usage, with revenues being higher during the winter months.  Unusually mild weather in the winter months could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition.  Conversely, extreme cold weather conditions could increase our results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring.



The states in which CERC provides regulated local natural gas distribution may, either through legislation or rules, adopt restrictions regarding organization, financing and affiliate transactions that could have significant adverse impacts on CERC’s ability to operate.



From time to time, proposals have been put forth in some of the states in which CERC does business to give state regulatory authorities increased jurisdiction and scrutiny over organization, capital structure, intracompany relationships and lines of business that could be pursued by registered holding companies and their affiliates that operate in those states. Some of these frameworks attempt to regulate financing activities, acquisitions and divestitures, and arrangements between the utilities and their affiliates, and to restrict the level of non-utility business that can be conducted within the holding company structure. Additionally, they may impose record-keeping, record access, employee training and reporting requirements related to affiliate transactions and reporting in the event of certain downgrading of the utility’s credit rating.



These regulatory frameworks could have adverse effects on CERC’s ability to conduct its utility operations, to finance its business and to provide cost-effective utility service. In addition, if more than one state adopts restrictions on similar activities, it may be difficult for CERC and us to comply with competing regulatory requirements.



CERC’s businesses must compete with alternate energy sources, which could result in CERC marketing less natural gas, which could have an adverse impact on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.



CERC competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources. In some areas, intrastate pipelines, other natural gas distributors and marketers also compete directly with CERC for natural gas sales to end users. In addition, as a result of federal regulatory changes affecting interstate pipelines, natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be able to bypass CERC’s facilities and market, sell and/or transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial customers. Any reduction in the amount of natural gas marketed, sold or transported by CERC as a result of competition may have an adverse impact on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.












Risk Factors Affecting Our Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LP



We hold a substantial limited partnership interest in Enable (54.1% of Enable’s outstanding limited partnership interests as of December 31, 2016), as well as 50% of the management rights in Enable’s general partner and a 40% interest in the incentive distribution rights held by Enable’s general partner. As of December 31, 2016, we owned an aggregate of 14,520,000 Series A Preferred Units in Enable. Accordingly, our future earnings, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will be affected by the performance of Enable, the amount of cash distributions we receive from Enable and the value of our interests in Enable.  Factors that may have a material impact on Enable’s performance and cash distributions, and, hence, the value of our interests in Enable, include the risk factors outlined below, as well as the risks described elsewhere under “Risk Factors” that are applicable to Enable.



Our cash flows will be adversely impacted if we receive less cash distributions from Enable than we currently expect.





•the fees and gross margins it realizes with respect to the volume of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil that it handles;



•the prices of, levels of production of, and demand for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;



•the volume of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil it gathers, compresses, treats, dehydrates, processes, fractionates, transports and stores;



•the relationship among prices for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;



•cash calls and settlements of hedging positions;



•margin requirements on open price risk management assets and liabilities;



•the level of competition from other midstream energy companies;



•adverse effects of governmental and environmental regulation;



•the level of its operation and maintenance expenses and general and administrative costs; and



•prevailing economic conditions.



In addition, the actual amount of cash Enable will have available for distribution will depend on other factors, including:



•the level and timing of its capital expenditures;



•the cost of acquisitions;












•its debt service requirements and other liabilities;



•fluctuations in its working capital needs;



•its ability to borrow funds and access capital markets;



•restrictions contained in its debt agreements;



•the amount of cash reserves established by its general partner;



•distributions paid on its Series A Preferred Units; and



•other business risks affecting its cash levels.



The amount of cash Enable has available for distribution to us on its common and subordinated units and Series A Preferred Units depends primarily on its cash flow rather than on its profitability, which may prevent Enable from making distributions, even during periods in which Enable records net income.



The amount of cash Enable has available for distribution on its common and subordinated units and Series A Preferred Units, depends primarily upon its cash flows and not solely on profitability, which will be affected by non-cash items. As a result, Enable may make cash distributions during periods when it records losses for financial accounting purposes and may not make cash distributions during periods when it records net earnings for financial accounting purposes.



Enable’s Series A Preferred Units are required to be redeemed in certain circumstances if they are not eligible for trading on the NYSE, and Enable may not have sufficient funds to redeem its Series A Preferred Units if required to do so.



As a holder of Enable’s Series A Preferred Units, we may request that Enable list those units for trading on the NYSE. If Enable is unable to list the Series A Preferred Units in certain circumstances, it will be required to redeem the Series A Preferred Units. There can be no assurance that Enable would have sufficient financial resources available to satisfy its obligation to redeem the Series A Preferred Units. In addition, mandatory redemption of the Series A Preferred Units could have a material adverse effect on Enable’s business, financial position, results of operations and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders.



We are not able to exercise control over Enable, which entails certain risks.



Enable is controlled jointly by CERC Corp. and OGE, who each own 50% of the management rights in the general partner of Enable.  The board of directors of Enable’s general partner is composed of an equal number of directors appointed by OGE and by us, the president and chief executive officer of Enable’s general partner and three directors who are independent as defined under the independence standards established by the NYSE.  Accordingly, we are not able to exercise control over Enable.



Although we jointly control Enable with OGE, we may have conflicts of interest with Enable that could subject us to claims that we have breached our fiduciary duty to Enable and its unitholders.



CERC Corp. and OGE each own 50% of the management rights in Enable’s general partner, as well as limited partnership interests in Enable, and interests in the incentive distribution rights held by Enable’s general partner.  We also hold Series A Preferred Units in Enable.  Conflicts of interest may arise between us and Enable and its unitholders. Our joint control of the general partner of Enable may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to Enable. In resolving these conflicts, we may favor our own interests and the interests of our affiliates over the interests of Enable and its unitholders as long as the resolution does not conflict with Enable’s partnership agreement. These circumstances could subject us to claims that, in favoring our own interests and those of our affiliates, we breached a fiduciary duty to Enable or its unitholders.



Enable’s contracts are subject to renewal risks.



As contracts with its existing suppliers and customers expire, Enable may have to negotiate extensions or renewals of those contracts or enter into new contracts with other suppliers and customers. Enable may be unable to extend or renew existing contracts or enter into new contracts on favorable commercial terms, if at all. Depending on prevailing market conditions at the time of an extension or renewal, gathering and processing customers with fee based contracts may desire to enter into contracts under different fee arrangements. Approximately 87% of Enable’s gross margin was generated from fee-based contracts during the year ended December 31, 2016. Likewise, Enable’s transportation and storage customers may choose not to extend or renew expiring contracts










based on the economics of the related areas of production. To the extent Enable is unable to renew or replace its expiring contracts on terms that are favorable, if at all, or successfully manage its overall contract mix over time, its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected.



Enable depends on a small number of customers for a significant portion of its gathering and processing services revenues and its transportation and storage services revenues. The loss of, or reduction in volumes from, these customers could result in a decline in sales of its gathering and processing or transportation and storage services and adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.



For the year ended December 31, 2016, 49% of Enable’s gathered natural gas volumes were attributable to the affiliates of Continental, Vine, GeoSouthern, XTO Energy and Apache and 51% of its transportation and storage service revenues were attributable to affiliates of CenterPoint Energy, Spire, XTO Energy, American Electric Power Company and OGE.



The loss of all or even a portion of the gathering and processing or transportation and storage services for any of these customers, the failure to extend or replace these contracts or the extension or replacement of these contracts on less favorable terms, as a result of competition or otherwise, could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.



Enable’s businesses are dependent, in part, on the drilling and production decisions of others.





•the availability and cost of capital;



•prevailing and projected commodity prices, including the prices of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;



•demand for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;



•levels of reserves;



•geological considerations;



•environmental or other governmental regulations, including the availability of drilling permits and the regulation of hydraulic fracturing; and



•the availability of drilling rigs and other costs of production and equipment.



Fluctuations in energy prices can also greatly affect the development of new natural gas, NGL and crude oil reserves. Drilling and production activity generally decreases as commodity prices decrease. In general terms, the prices of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and other hydrocarbon products fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond Enable’s control. Because of these factors, even if new natural gas, NGL or crude oil reserves are known to exist in areas served by Enable’s assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves. Declines in natural gas, NGL or crude oil prices can have a negative impact on exploration, development and production activity and, if sustained, could lead to decreases in such activity.  In early 2016, natural gas and crude oil prices dropped to their lowest levels in over 10 years. Both natural gas and crude oil prices increased moderately in the second half of 2016. Sustained low natural gas, NGL or crude oil prices could also lead producers to shut in production from their existing wells. Sustained reductions in exploration or production activity in Enable’s areas of operation could lead to further reductions in the utilization of its systems, which could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.












In addition, it may be more difficult to maintain or increase the current volumes on Enable’s gathering systems and processing plants, as several of the formations in the unconventional resource plays in which it operates generally have higher initial production rates and steeper production decline curves than wells in more conventional basins. Should Enable determine that the economics of its gathering assets do not justify the capital expenditures needed to grow or maintain volumes associated therewith, Enable may reduce such capital expenditures, which could cause revenues associated with these assets to decline over time. In addition to capital expenditures to support growth, the steeper production decline curves associated with unconventional resource plays may require Enable to incur higher maintenance capital expenditures relative to throughput over time, which will reduce its distributable cash flow.



Because of these and other factors, even if new reserves are known to exist in areas served by Enable’s assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves. Reductions in drilling activity would result in Enable’s inability to maintain the current levels of throughput on its systems and could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.



Enable’s industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.





Enable may not be able to recover the costs of its substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions, and the actual cost of such improvements and additions may be significantly higher than it anticipates.



Enable’s business plan calls for investment in capital improvements and additions. In Enable’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, Enable stated that it expects that its expansion capital could range from approximately $455 million to $575 million and its maintenance capital could range from approximately $95 million to $125 million for the year ending December 31, 2017. In the second quarter of 2016, Enable delayed the completion of the Wildhorse Plant, a cryogenic processing facility that it plans to connect to its super-header system in Garvin County, Oklahoma. Enable also plans to construct natural gas gathering and compression infrastructure to support producer activity.














In connection with Enable’s capital investments, Enable may estimate, or engage a third party to estimate, potential reserves in areas to be developed prior to constructing facilities in those areas. To the extent Enable relies on estimates of future production in deciding to construct additions to its systems, those estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating future production. As a result, new facilities may not be able to attract sufficient throughput to achieve expected investment return, which could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions. In addition, the construction of additions to existing gathering and transportation assets may require new rights-of-way prior to construction. Those rights-of-way to connect new natural gas supplies to existing gathering lines may be unavailable and Enable may not be able to capitalize on attractive expansion opportunities. Additionally, it may become more expensive to obtain new rights-of-way or to renew existing rights-of-way. If the cost of renewing or obtaining new rights-of-way increases, Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected.



Natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices are volatile, and changes in these prices could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.



Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be negatively affected by adverse movements in the prices of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil depending on factors that are beyond Enable’s control. These factors include demand for these commodities, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors, including the impact of seasonality and weather, general economic conditions, the level of domestic and offshore natural gas production and consumption, the availability of imported natural gas, LNG, NGLs and crude oil, actions taken by foreign natural gas and oil producing nations, the availability of local, intrastate and interstate transportation systems, the availability and marketing of competitive fuels, the impact of energy conservation efforts, technological advances affecting energy consumption and the extent of governmental regulation and taxation.  In early 2016, natural gas and crude oil prices dropped to their lowest levels in over 10 years. Both natural gas and crude oil prices increased moderately in the second half of 2016.



Enable’s natural gas processing arrangements expose it to commodity price fluctuations. In 2016, 8%, 46%, and 46% of Enable’s processing plant inlet volumes consisted of keep-whole arrangements, percent-of-proceeds or percent-of-liquids and fee-based, respectively. Under a typical keep-whole arrangement, Enable processes raw natural gas, extracts the NGLs, replaces the extracted NGLs with a Btu equivalent amount of natural gas, delivers the processed and replacement natural gas to the producer, retains the NGLs and sells the NGLs for its own account. If Enable is unable to sell the NGLs extracted for more than the cost of the replacement natural gas, the margins on its sale of goods will be negatively affected.



Under a typical percent-of-proceeds processing arrangement, Enable purchases raw natural gas at a cost that is based on the amount of natural gas and NGLs contained in the raw natural gas. Enable then processes the raw natural gas, extracts the NGLs and sells the processed natural gas and NGLs for its own account. If Enable is unable to sell the processed natural gas and NGLs for more than the cost of the raw natural gas, the margins on its sale of goods will be negatively affected.



Under a typical percent-of-liquids processing arrangement and a typical fee-based arrangement, Enable purchases a portion of the raw natural gas that is equivalent to the amount of NGLs it contains, processes the raw natural gas, extracts the NGLs, returns the processed natural gas to the producer and sells the NGLs for its own account. If Enable is unable to sell the processed natural gas and NGLs for more than the cost of raw natural gas, the margins on its sale of goods will be negatively affected.



At any given time, Enable’s overall portfolio of processing contracts may reflect a net short position in natural gas (meaning that Enable is a net buyer of natural gas) and a net long position in NGLs (meaning that Enable is a net seller of NGLs). As a result, Enable’s gross margin could be adversely impacted to the extent the price of NGLs decreases in relation to the price of natural gas.



Enable is exposed to credit risks of its customers, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by its key customers could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.



Some of Enable’s customers may experience financial problems that could have a significant effect on their creditworthiness. Severe financial problems encountered by its customers could limit Enable’s ability to collect amounts owed to it, or to enforce performance of obligations under contractual arrangements. In addition, many of Enable’s customers finance their activities through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. The combination of reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facility and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction of its customers’ liquidity and limit their ability to make payment or perform on their obligations to Enable. Furthermore, some of Enable’s customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks, which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to Enable. Financial problems experienced by Enable’s customers could result in the impairment of its assets, reduction of its operating cash flows and may also reduce or curtail their future use of its products and services, which could reduce Enable’s revenues.












Enable provides certain transportation and storage services under fixed-price “negotiated rate” contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if its cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts, and, as a result, Enable’s costs could exceed its revenues received under such contracts.



Enable has been authorized by the FERC to provide transportation and storage services at its facilities at negotiated rates. Generally, negotiated rates are in excess of the maximum recourse rates allowed by the FERC, but it is possible that costs to perform services under “negotiated rate” contracts will exceed the revenues obtained under these agreements. If this occurs, it could decrease the cash flow realized by Enable’s systems and, therefore, decrease the cash it has available for distribution.



As of December 31, 2016, approximately 54% of Enable’s contracted firm transportation capacity and 44% of its contracted firm storage capacity was subscribed under such “negotiated rate” contracts.  These contracts generally do not include provisions allowing for adjustment for increased costs due to inflation, pipeline safety activities or other factors that are not tied to an applicable tracking mechanism authorized by the FERC. Successful recovery of any shortfall of revenue, representing the difference between “recourse rates” (if higher) and negotiated rates, is not assured under current FERC policies.



If third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to Enable’s gathering, processing or transportation facilities become partially or fully unavailable for any reason, Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected.



Enable depends upon third-party pipelines to deliver natural gas to, and take natural gas from, its natural gas transportation systems and upon third-party pipelines to take crude oil from its crude oil gathering systems. Enable also depends on third-party facilities to transport and fractionate NGLs that are delivered to the third party at the tailgates of Enable’s processing plants. Fractionation is the separation of the heterogeneous mixture of extracted NGLs into individual components for end-use sale. For example, an outage or disruption on certain pipelines or fractionators operated by a third party could result in the shutdown of certain of Enable’s processing plants and gathering systems, and a prolonged outage or disruption could ultimately result in a reduction in the volume of natural gas Enable gathers and NGLs it is able to produce. Additionally, Enable depends on third parties to provide electricity for compression at many of its facilities. Since Enable does not own or operate any of these third-party pipelines or other facilities, their continuing operation is not within its control. If any of these third-party pipelines or other facilities become partially or fully unavailable for any reason, Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected.



Enable does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt its operations.



Enable does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities have been constructed, and it is therefore subject to the possibility of more onerous terms and/or increased costs to retain necessary land use if it does not have valid rights-of-way or if such rights-of-way lapse or terminate. Enable may obtain the rights to construct and operate its pipelines on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. A loss of these rights, through Enable’s inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could cause it to cease operations temporarily or permanently on the affected land, increase costs related to the construction and continuing operations elsewhere and adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.



Enable conducts a portion of its operations through joint ventures, which subject it to additional risks that could adversely affect the success of these operations and Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.



Enable conducts a portion of its operations through joint ventures with third parties, including Spectra Energy Partners, LP, DCP Midstream Partners, LP, Trans Louisiana Gas Pipeline, Inc. and Pablo Gathering LLC. Enable may also enter into other joint venture arrangements in the future. These third parties may have obligations that are important to the success of the joint venture, such as the obligation to pay their share of capital and other costs of the joint venture. The performance of these third-party obligations, including the ability of the third parties to satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, is outside Enable’s control. If these parties do not satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, Enable’s business may be adversely affected.



Enable’s joint venture arrangements may involve risks not otherwise present when operating assets directly, including, for example:



•Enable’s joint venture partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions;



•Enable’s joint venture partners may not pay their share of the joint venture’s obligations, leaving Enable liable for their shares of joint venture liabilities;












•Enable may be unable to control the amount of cash it will receive from the joint venture;



•Enable may incur liabilities as a result of an action taken by its joint venture partners;



•Enable may be required to devote significant management time to the requirements of and matters relating to the joint ventures;



•Enable’s insurance policies may not fully cover loss or damage incurred by both Enable and its joint venture partners in certain circumstances;



•Enable’s joint venture partners may be in a position to take actions contrary to its instructions or requests or contrary to its policies or objectives; and



•disputes between Enable and its joint venture partners may result in delays, litigation or operational impasses.



The risks described above or the failure to continue Enable’s joint ventures or to resolve disagreements with its joint venture partners could adversely affect its ability to transact the business that is the subject of such joint venture, which would in turn adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions. The agreements under which Enable formed certain joint ventures may subject it to various risks, limit the actions it may take with respect to the assets subject to the joint venture and require Enable to grant rights to its joint venture partners that could limit its ability to benefit fully from future positive developments. Some joint ventures require Enable to make significant capital expenditures. If Enable does not timely meet its financial commitments or otherwise does not comply with its joint venture agreements, its rights to participate, exercise operator rights or otherwise influence or benefit from the joint venture may be adversely affected. Certain of Enable’s joint venture partners may have substantially greater financial resources than Enable has and Enable may not be able to secure the funding necessary to participate in operations its joint venture partners propose, thereby reducing its ability to benefit from the joint venture.



Enable’s ability to grow is dependent on its ability to access external financing sources.



Enable expects that it will distribute all of its “available cash” to its unitholders.  As a result, Enable is expected to rely primarily upon external financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures. As a result, to the extent Enable is unable to finance growth externally, Enable’s cash distribution policy will significantly impair its ability to grow. In addition, because Enable is expected to distribute all of its available cash, its growth may not be as fast as businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations.



To the extent Enable issues additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures, the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that Enable will be unable to maintain or increase its per unit distribution level, which in turn may impact the available cash that it has to distribute on each unit. There are no limitations in Enable’s partnership agreement on its ability to issue additional units, including units ranking senior to the common units. The incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt by Enable to finance its growth strategy would result in increased interest expense, which in turn may negatively impact the available cash that Enable has to distribute to its unitholders.



Enable depends on access to the capital markets to fund its expansion capital expenditures. Historically, unit prices of midstream master limited partnerships have experienced periods of volatility. In addition, because Enable’s common units are yield-based securities, rising market interest rates could impact the relative attractiveness of its common units to investors. As a result of capital market volatility, Enable may be unable to issue equity or debt on satisfactory terms, or at all, which may limit its ability to expand its operations or make future acquisitions.



Enable’s debt levels may limit its flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities.



As of December 31, 2016, Enable had approximately $3.0 billion of long-term debt outstanding, excluding the premiums on their senior notes. Enable has a $1.75 billion revolving credit facility for working capital, capital expenditures and other partnership purposes, including acquisitions, of which $1.1 billion was available as of February 1, 2017. Enable will continue to have the ability to incur additional debt, subject to limitations in its credit facilities. The levels of Enable’s debt could have important consequences, including the following:



•the ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or the financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all;












•a portion of cash flows will be required to make interest payments on the debt, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations, future business opportunities and distributions;



•Enable’s debt level will make it more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in its business or the economy generally; and



•Enable’s debt level may limit its flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions.



Enable’s ability to service its debt will depend upon, among other things, its future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions, commodity prices and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond Enable’s control. If operating results are not sufficient to service current or future indebtedness, Enable may be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions, reducing or delaying business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing debt, or seeking additional equity capital. These actions may not be effected on satisfactory terms, or at all.



Enable’s credit facilities contain operating and financial restrictions, including covenants and restrictions that may be affected by events beyond Enable’s control, which could adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions.



Enable’s credit facilities contain customary covenants that, among other things, limit its ability to:



•permit its subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional debt;



•incur or permit to exist certain liens on assets;



•dispose of assets;



•merge or consolidate with another company or engage in a change of control;



•enter into transactions with affiliates on non-arm’s length terms; and



•change the nature of its business.



Enable’s credit facilities also require it to maintain certain financial ratios. Enable’s ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond its control, and we cannot assure you that it will meet those ratios. In addition, Enable’s credit facilities contain events of default customary for agreements of this nature.



Enable’s ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in its credit facilities may be affected by events beyond its control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, Enable’s ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. If Enable violates any of the restrictions, covenants, ratios or tests in its credit facilities, a significant portion of its indebtedness may become immediately due and payable. In addition, Enable’s lenders’ commitments to make further loans to it under the revolving credit facility may be suspended or terminated. Enable might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.



Enable may be unable to obtain or renew permits necessary for its operations, which could inhibit its ability to do business.



Performance of Enable’s operations require that Enable obtains and maintains a number of federal and state permits, licenses and approvals with terms and conditions containing a significant number of prescriptive limits and performance standards in order to operate. All of these permits, licenses, approval limits and standards require a significant amount of monitoring, record keeping and reporting in order to demonstrate compliance with the underlying permit, license, approval limit or standard. Noncompliance or incomplete documentation of Enable’s compliance status may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive relief. A decision by a government agency to deny or delay the issuance of a new or existing material permit or other approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or other approval, could adversely affect Enable’s ability to initiate or continue operations at the affected location or facility and on its financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.



Additionally, in order to obtain permits and renewals of permits and other approvals in the future, Enable may be required to prepare and present data to governmental authorities pertaining to the potential adverse impact that any proposed pipeline or processing-related activities may have on the environment, individually or in the aggregate, including on public and Indian lands.










Certain approval procedures may require preparation of archaeological surveys, endangered species studies and other studies to assess the environmental impact of new sites or the expansion of existing sites. Compliance with these regulatory requirements is expensive and significantly lengthens the time required to prepare applications and to receive authorizations.



Costs of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations are significant, and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.







Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in natural gas production by Enable’s customers, which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.



Hydraulic fracturing is common practice that is used by many of Enable’s customers to stimulate production of natural gas and crude oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand, and chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. In addition, certain federal agencies have proposed additional laws and regulations to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process. For example, in May 2016, the EPA issued final new source performance standard requirements that impose more stringent controls on methane and volatile organic compounds emissions from oil and gas development and production operations, including hydraulic fracturing and other well completion activity.  The EPA also released the final results of its comprehensive research study on the potential adverse impacts that hydraulic fracturing may have on drinking water resources in December 2016. The EPA concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances, including large volume spills and inadequate mechanical










integrity of wells. The results of EPA’s study could spur action towards federal legislation and regulation of hydraulic fracturing or similar production operations. In past sessions, Congress has considered, but not passed, legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. The EPA has issued the Safe Water Drinking Act permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing operations involving the use of diesel fuel in fracturing fluids in those states where the EPA is the permitting authority. Additionally, the Bureau of Land Management issued final rules to regulate hydraulic fracturing on federal lands in March 2015. Although these rules were struck down by a federal court in Wyoming in June 2016, an appeal of the decision is still pending.



Some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. Local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular, in some cases banning hydraulic fracturing entirely. If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where Enable’s oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate, they could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells, some or all of which activities could adversely affect demand for Enable’s services to those customers.





Other governmental agencies, including the DOE, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act or other regulatory mechanisms.



Enable’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local regulatory authorities. Changes or additional regulatory measures adopted by such authorities could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.



The rates charged by several of Enable’s pipeline systems, including for interstate gas transportation service provided by its intrastate pipelines, are regulated by the FERC. Enable’s pipeline operations that are not regulated by the FERC may be subject to state and local regulation applicable to intrastate natural and transportation services. The relevant states in which Enable operates include North Dakota, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, Missouri, Kansas, Mississippi, Tennessee and Illinois.



The FERC and state regulatory agencies also regulate other terms and conditions of the services Enable may offer. If one of these regulatory agencies, on its own initiative or due to challenges by third parties, were to lower its tariff rates or deny any rate increase or other material changes to the types, or terms and conditions, of service Enable might propose or offer, the profitability of Enable’s pipeline businesses could suffer. If Enable were permitted to raise its tariff rates for a particular pipeline, there might be significant delay between the time the tariff rate increase is approved and the time that the rate increase actually goes into effect, which could also limit its profitability. Furthermore, competition from other pipeline systems may prevent Enable from raising its tariff rates even if regulatory agencies permit it to do so. The regulatory agencies that regulate Enable’s systems periodically implement new rules, regulations and terms and conditions of services subject to their jurisdiction. New initiatives or orders may adversely affect the rates charged for Enable’s services or otherwise adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and cash flows and ability to make cash distributions.












A change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of Enable’s assets by federal, state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of its assets, which may cause its revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase.





Natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at the state level; therefore, Enable’s natural gas gathering operations could be adversely affected should they become subject to the application of state regulation of rates and services. Enable’s gathering operations could also be subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design, construction, testing, operation, replacement and maintenance of gathering facilities. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on Enable’s operations, but Enable could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes.



Other Risk Factors Affecting Our Businesses or Our Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LP



We are subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities arising from environmental laws and regulations.



Our operations and the operations of Enable are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to the environment. As an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines, distribution systems and storage, electric transmission and distribution systems, and the facilities that support these systems, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as:



•restricting the way we can handle or dispose of wastes;



•limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, coastal regions, or areas inhabited by endangered species;



•requiring remedial action to mitigate environmental conditions caused by our operations, or attributable to former operations;



•enjoining the operations of facilities with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations; and



•impacting the demand for our services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of natural gas.



To comply with these requirements, we may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to:



•construct or acquire new facilities and equipment;



•acquire permits for facility operations;












•modify or replace existing and proposed equipment; and



•clean or decommission waste management areas, fuel storage facilities and other locations.



Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial actions, and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean and restore sites where hazardous substances have been stored, disposed or released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment.



The recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment, and thus there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be greater than the amounts we currently anticipate.



Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient. Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.



We currently have general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of our facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of our facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.



In common with other companies in its line of business that serve coastal regions, Houston Electric does not have insurance covering its transmission and distribution system, other than substations, because Houston Electric believes it to be cost prohibitive. In the future, Houston Electric may not be able to recover the costs incurred in restoring its transmission and distribution properties following hurricanes or other disasters through issuance of storm restoration bonds or a change in its regulated rates or otherwise, or any such recovery may not be timely granted. Therefore, Houston Electric may not be able to restore any loss of, or damage to, any of its transmission and distribution properties without negative impact on its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.



Our operations and Enable’s operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards inherent in the gathering, processing, transportation and storage of natural gas and crude oil, including:



•damage to pipelines and plants, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires and other natural disasters, acts of terrorism and actions by third parties;



•inadvertent damage from construction, vehicles, farm and utility equipment;



•leaks of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and other hydrocarbons or losses of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities;



•ruptures, fires and explosions; and



•other hazards that could also result in personal injury and loss of life, pollution and suspension of operations.



Enable currently has general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of its facilities in amounts that Enable considers appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles.  Enable is not fully insured against all risks inherent in its business. These risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury and/or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage. These risks may also result in curtailment or suspension of Enable’s operations. A natural disaster or other hazard affecting the areas in which Enable operates could have a material adverse effect on Enable’s operations. Enable does not have business interruption insurance coverage for all of its operations. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of Enable’s facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on its results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions.












We, Houston Electric and CERC could incur liabilities associated with businesses and assets that we have transferred to others.



Under some circumstances, we, Houston Electric and CERC could incur liabilities associated with assets and businesses we, Houston Electric and CERC no longer own. These assets and businesses were previously owned by Reliant Energy, a predecessor of Houston Electric, directly or through subsidiaries and include:



•merchant energy, energy trading and REP businesses transferred to RRI or its subsidiaries in connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI prior to its initial public offering in 2001 and now owned by affiliates of NRG; and



•Texas electric generating facilities transferred to a subsidiary of Texas Genco in 2002, later sold to a third party and now owned by an affiliate of NRG.



In connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI (now GenOn) and Texas Genco (now an affiliate of NRG), those companies and/or their subsidiaries assumed liabilities associated with various assets and businesses transferred to them and agreed to certain indemnity agreements of CenterPoint Energy entities. Such indemnities have applied in cases such as the litigation arising out of sales of natural gas in California and other markets (the last remaining case involving CenterPoint Energy is now on appeal, following the district court’s summary judgment in favor of CES, a subsidiary of CERC Corp.) and various asbestos and other environmental matters that arise from time to time. GenOn has publicly disclosed that it may be unable to continue as a going concern and is exploring various options, including negotiations with creditors and lessors, refinancing, potential sale of assets, as well as the possibility of filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. If any of the indemnifying entities were unable to meet their indemnity obligations or satisfy a liability that has been assumed or if claims in one or more of these lawsuits were successfully asserted against us, we, Houston Electric or CERC could incur liability and be responsible for satisfying the liability.



In connection with our sale of Texas Genco, the separation agreement was amended to provide that Texas Genco would no longer be liable for, and we would assume and agree to indemnify Texas Genco against, liabilities that Texas Genco originally assumed in connection with its organization to the extent, and only to the extent, that such liabilities are covered by certain insurance policies held by us, and in certain of the asbestos lawsuits we have agreed to continue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered by insurance maintained by us, subject to reimbursement of the costs of such defense by an NRG affiliate.



Cyber-attacks, physical security breaches, acts of terrorism or other disruptions could adversely impact our or Enable’s results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.





Cyber-attacks and unauthorized access could also result in the loss of confidential, proprietary or critical infrastructure data or security breaches of other information technology systems that could disrupt operations and critical business functions, adversely affect reputation, increase costs and subject us or Enable to possible legal claims and liability. Neither we nor Enable is fully insured against all cyber-security risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on either our, or Enable’s, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.



In addition, our and Enable’s critical energy infrastructure may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our respective business operations. Any such disruptions could result in significant costs to repair damaged facilities and implement increased security measures, which could have a material adverse effect on either our or Enable’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.












Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect us.



In connection with our business we collect and retain personally identifiable information of our customers, shareholders and employees. Our customers, shareholders and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information, and the United States regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer, shareholder, employee or CenterPoint Energy data by cyber-crime or otherwise could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs, fines and litigation.



Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully operate our facilities or perform certain corporate functions.



Our performance depends on the successful operation of our facilities. Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:



•operator error or failure of equipment or processes;



•operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements;



•labor disputes;



•information technology or financial system failures that impair our information technology infrastructure, reporting systems or disrupt normal business operations;



•information technology failure that affects our ability to access customer information or causes us to lose confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects our reputation or exposes us to legal claims; and



•catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, leaks, floods, droughts, hurricanes, terrorism, pandemic health events or other similar occurrences.



Such events may result in a decrease or elimination of revenue from our facilities, an increase in the cost of operating our facilities or delays in cash collections, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.



Our success depends upon our ability to attract, effectively transition and retain key employees and identify and develop talent to succeed senior management.



We depend on our senior executive officers and other key personnel. Our success depends on our ability to attract, effectively transition and retain key personnel. The inability to recruit and retain or effectively transition key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations. In addition, because of the reliance on our management team, our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management. The retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be critically important to the successful implementation of our strategies.



Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could adversely impact our results of operations.



Our business is dependent on our ability to recruit, retain, and motivate employees. Certain circumstances, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, a mismatch of existing skillsets to future needs, or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as a lack of resources, loss of knowledge or a lengthy time period associated with skill development. Our costs, including costs to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business. If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our results of operations could be negatively affected.



Climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our services or Enable’s services.



Regulatory agencies have from time to time considered adopting legislation, including modification of existing laws and regulations, to reduce GHGs, and there continues to be a wide-ranging policy and regulatory debate, both nationally and












Climate changes could result in more frequent and more severe weather events which could adversely affect the results of operations of our businesses.



To the extent climate changes occur, our businesses may be adversely impacted, though we believe any such impacts are likely to occur very gradually and hence would be difficult to quantify with specificity.  To the extent global climate change results in warmer temperatures in our service territories, financial results from our natural gas distribution businesses could be adversely affected through lower gas sales, and Enable’s natural gas gathering, processing and transportation and crude oil gathering businesses could experience lower revenues.  Another possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes or tornadoes.  Since many of our facilities are located along or near the Gulf Coast, increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers.  When we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services, our financial results can be impacted by lost revenues, and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs.  To the extent we are unable to recover those costs, or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for our services, our future financial results may be adversely impacted.



We may be negatively impacted by changes in federal income tax policy.



The Executive and Legislative Branches of the United States Federal government have made public statements in support of comprehensive tax reform plans, including significant changes to corporate income tax laws. We are currently unable to predict whether these reform discussions will result in any significant changes to existing tax laws, or if any such changes would have a cumulative positive or negative impact on us or our regulatory activities.  It is possible that changes in the United States federal income tax laws could have an adverse effect on our or Enable’s results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.



CERC and Enable may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairs.



The DOT has adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for transportation pipelines located in “high consequence areas,” which are those areas where a leak or rupture could do the most harm. The regulations require pipeline operators, including CERC and Enable, to, among other things:



•perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;



•develop a baseline plan to prioritize the assessment of a covered pipeline segment;



•identify and characterize applicable threats that could impact a high consequence area;



•improve data collection, integration, and analysis;



•develop processes  for performance management, record keeping, management of change and communication;



•repair and remediate pipelines as necessary; and



•implement preventive and mitigating action.












Recent regulatory proposals from PHMSA would expand the scope of its safety, reporting and recordkeeping requirements for both natural gas and hazardous liquids (including crude oil and NGLs) pipelines, as well as underground natural gas storage facilities.  These proposals, if finalized, would impose additional costs on us and Enable.





PHMSA also issued a similar notice of proposed rulemaking for hazardous liquid pipelines in October 2015. Both of these notices of proposed rulemaking would require inspections of pipeline areas affected by severe weather, natural disasters or similar events. In addition, the proposed hazardous liquid rule would extend PHMSA reporting requirements to all gathering lines, require periodic inline inspections of pipelines outside of high consequence areas, require use of leak detection systems on all hazardous liquid pipelines, modify applicable repair criteria and set a timeline for pipelines subject to integrity management requirements to be capable of accommodating inline inspection tools.  PHMSA issued the final rule for hazardous liquid pipelines on January 13, 2017, but the rule’s eventual implementation and effectiveness are uncertain as a result of a January 20, 2017 regulatory freeze.  We will continue to monitor the status of this rulemaking and the effect of these proposed requirements on operations.



On December 14, 2016, PHMSA announced an interim final rule to impose industry-developed recommendations as enforceable safety standards for downhole (underground) equipment, including wells, wellbore tubing, and casing, at both interstate and intrastate underground natural gas storage facilities. This rule went into effect on January 18, 2017, with a compliance deadline of January 18, 2018. Both CERC and Enable own and operate underground storage facilities that will be subject to this rule’s provisions, which include procedures and practices for operations, maintenance, threat identification, monitoring, assessment, site security, emergency response and preparedness, training and recordkeeping. States may also impose more stringent standards on intrastate storage facilities. CERC and Enable continue to assess the potential impact of this newly announced rule.



Although many of CERC’s and Enable’s pipelines fall within a class that is currently not subject to the requirements in PHMSA’s recent proposals, they may nonetheless incur significant cost and liabilities associated with repair, remediation, prevention or mitigation measures associated with their non-exempt pipelines, which are subject to existing requirements.  Work associated with PHMSA requirements is part of CERC’s and Enable’s normal integrity management program and neither expect to incur any extraordinary costs during 2017 to complete the testing required by existing DOT regulations and their state counterparts. CERC and Enable have not estimated the costs for any repair, remediation, preventive or mitigation actions that may be determined to be necessary as a result of the testing program, which could be substantial, or any lost cash flows resulting from shutting down their pipelines during the pendency of such repairs. Should CERC or Enable fail to comply with DOT or comparable state regulations, they could be subject to penalties and fines.



Aging infrastructure may lead to increased costs and disruptions in operations that could negatively impact our financial results.



CenterPoint Energy has risks associated with aging infrastructure assets.  The age of certain of our assets may result in a need for replacement, or higher level of maintenance costs as a result of our risk based federal and state compliant integrity management programs.  Failure to achieve timely recovery of these expenses could adversely impact revenues and could result in increased capital expenditures or expenses.



The operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees.



Several of our businesses have entered into and have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions. There are seven separate bargaining units in CenterPoint Energy, each with a unique collective bargaining agreement.  In 2016, Houston Electric entered into a renegotiated collective bargaining agreement with the IBEW Local 66, which is scheduled to expire in 2020, and CERC entered into two renegotiated collective bargaining agreements with Professional Employees










International Union Local 12, which are scheduled to expire in 2021. Two collective bargaining agreements with United Steelworkers Local 227 and United Steelworkers Local 13-1 are scheduled to expire in June and July of 2017, respectively.  The collective bargaining agreements with Gas Workers Union, Local 340 and the IBEW Local 949 are scheduled to expire in April and December of 2020, respectively. Any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes, boycotts or other labor disruptions. These potential labor disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows. Labor disruptions, strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases, whether due to union activities, employee turnover or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows.



Our businesses will continue to have to adapt to technological change and may not be successful or may have to incur significant expenditures to adapt to technological change.



We operate in businesses that require sophisticated data collection, processing systems, software and other technology. Some of the technologies supporting the industries we serve are changing rapidly. We expect that new technologies will emerge or grow that may be superior to, or may not be compatible with, some of our existing technologies, and may require us to make significant expenditures so that we can continue to provide cost-effective and reliable methods of energy delivery.  Among such technological advances are distributed generation resources (e.g., rooftop solar), energy storage devices and more energy-efficient buildings and products designed to reduce consumption. As these technologies become a more cost-competitive option over time, certain customers may choose to meet their own energy needs and subsequently decrease usage of our systems and services.



Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt to these technological changes in a cost-effective manner and to offer, on a timely basis, reliable services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards. If we fail to adapt successfully to any technological change or obsolescence, or fail to obtain access to important technologies or incur significant expenditures in adapting to technological change, our businesses, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.



Our or Enable’s potential business strategies and strategic initiatives, including merger and acquisition activities and the disposition of assets or businesses, may not be completed or perform as expected.



From time to time, we and Enable have made and may continue to make acquisitions or divestitures of businesses and assets, form joint ventures or undertake restructurings.  However, suitable acquisition candidates or potential buyers may not continue to be available on terms and conditions we or Enable, as the case may be, find acceptable, or the expected benefits of completed acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all, or may not be realized in the anticipated timeframe. If we or Enable are unable to make acquisitions or if those acquisitions do not perform as anticipated, our and Enable’s future growth may be adversely affected.



Any completed or future acquisitions involve substantial risks, including the following:



•acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels;



•acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate;



•we or Enable may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us, that exceed our estimates, or for which our rights to indemnification from the seller are limited;



•we or Enable may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems; and



•acquisitions, or the pursuit of acquisitions, could disrupt ongoing businesses, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain current business standards, controls and procedures.



For example, the success of CERC’s acquisitions of Continuum and AEM will depend, in part, on its ability to realize the expected benefits, including operating efficiencies, cost savings and customer retention, from integrating Continuum and AEM with its existing energy services business. The integration process could be costly and time consuming and may result in the following challenges, among others:



•unanticipated disruptions, issues or costs in integrating financial and accounting, information technology, communications and other systems;












•potential inconsistencies in procedures, practices, policies, controls, and standards;



•possible differences in compensation arrangements, management perspectives and corporate culture; and



•loss of or difficulties retaining valuable employees or third-party relationships.



Even with the successful integration of the businesses, CERC may not achieve the expected results. CERC anticipates that its acquisitions of Continuum and AEM will be accretive to earnings in 2017. Any of the factors addressed above could decrease or delay the projected accretive effect of the transaction. Failure to fully realize the expected benefits could adversely affect CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.



In February 2016, we announced that we were exploring the use of a REIT business model for all or part of our utility businesses.  We have completed our evaluation and have decided not to pursue forming a REIT structure for our utility business or any part thereof at this time.  We also announced that we were evaluating strategic alternatives for our investment in Enable, including a sale or spin-off qualifying under Section 355 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, and we continue to evaluate our alternatives, including retaining our investment. There can be no assurances that these evaluations will result in any specific action, and we do not intend to disclose further developments on these initiatives unless and until our board of directors approves a specific action or as otherwise required.



Our business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist shareholders.



Publicly traded companies have increasingly become subject to campaigns by activist investors advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring, increased borrowing, special dividends, stock repurchases or even sales of assets or the entire company. It is possible that activist shareholders may attempt to effect such changes or acquire control over us. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of shareholder activism or changes to the composition of the board of directors may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business, instability or lack of continuity.  This may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel.



Our bylaws designate the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas or, if such court lacks jurisdiction, the state district court of Harris County, Texas as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could limit our shareholders’ flexibility in obtaining a judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.





We are involved in numerous legal proceedings, the outcome of which are uncertain, and resolutions adverse to us could negatively affect our financial results.



We are subject to numerous legal proceedings, the most significant of which are summarized in Note14 of the consolidated financial statements.  Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcome of individual matters with assurance. Final resolution of these matters may require additional expenditures over an extended period of time that may be in excess of established reserves and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results.












We are exposed to risks related to reduction in energy consumption due to factors including unfavorable economic conditions in our service territories, energy efficiency initiatives and use of alternative technologies.



Our businesses are affected by reduction in energy consumption due to factors including economic climate in our service territories, energy efficiency initiatives and use of alternative technologies, which could impact our ability to grow our customer base and our rate of growth. Declines in demand for electricity as a result of economic downturns in our regulated electric service territories will reduce overall sales and lessen cash flows, especially as industrial customers reduce production and, therefore, consumption of electricity. Although Houston Electric is subject to regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of certain costs under periodic adjustment clauses, overall declines in electricity sold as a result of economic downturn or recession could reduce revenues and cash flows, thereby diminishing results of operations. Additionally, prolonged economic downturns that negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows could result in future material impairment charges to write-down the carrying value of certain assets, including goodwill, to their respective fair values.



For example, our electric business is largely concentrated in Houston, Texas, where a higher percentage of employment is tied to the energy sector relative to other regions of the country.  Given the significant decline in energy and commodity prices in 2015 and 2016, and resulting low commodity prices which we expect to continue in 2017, the rate of growth in employment in Houston has declined. In the event economic conditions further decline, the rate of growth in Houston and the other areas in which we operate may also deteriorate. Increases in customer defaults or delays in payment due to liquidity constraints could negatively impact our cash flows and financial condition.



Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and the need for additional delivery facilities. Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside our control, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand-side management goals, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity.



Certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates. Additionally, technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of energy efficiency in end-use electric devices or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption.



Some or all of these factors, could result in a lack of growth or decline in customer demand for electricity or number of customers, and may result in our failure to fully realize anticipated benefits from significant capital investments and expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on their financial position, results of operations and cash flows.



Furthermore, we currently have energy efficiency riders in place to recover the cost of energy efficiency programs. Should we be required to invest in conservation measures that result in reduced sales from effective conservation, regulatory lag in adjusting rates for the impact of these measures could have a negative financial impact.



If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows or prevent fraud may be adversely affected. As a result, investors could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could impact our businesses and the trading price of our securities.



Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, effectively prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If our efforts to maintain internal controls are not successful, we are unable to maintain adequate controls over our financial reporting and processes in the future or we are unable to comply with our obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our operating results could be harmed or we may fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls also could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities.



Our businesses may be adversely affected by the intentional misconduct of our employees.



We are committed to living our core values of safety, integrity, accountability, initiative and respect and complying with all applicable laws and regulations. Despite that commitment and our efforts to prevent misconduct, it is possible for employees to engage in intentional misconduct, fail to uphold our core values, and violate laws and regulations for individual gain through contract or procurement fraud, misappropriation, bribery or corruption, fraudulent related-party transactions and serious breaches of our Ethics and Compliance Code and Standards of Conduct/Business Ethics policy, among other policies. If such intentional misconduct by employees should occur, it could result in substantial liability, higher costs, increased regulatory scrutiny and negative public perceptions.
