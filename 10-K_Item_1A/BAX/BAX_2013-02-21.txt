Item 1A.Risk Factors.

In
addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, shareholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors. If any of the events described below occurs, our business, financial condition and
results of operations and future growth prospects could suffer.

If we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep
pace with advances in technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We need to
successfully introduce new products to achieve our strategic business objectives. Product development requires substantial investment and there is inherent risk in the research and development process. A successful product development process
depends on many factors, including our ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs, adapt to new technologies, obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis, demonstrate satisfactory clinical results, manufacture products in an
economical and timely manner and differentiate our products from those of our competitors. If we cannot successfully introduce new products or adapt to changing technologies, our products may become obsolete and our revenue and profitability could
suffer.

We are subject to a number of existing laws and regulations, non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations, and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment.

As a participant in the
healthcare industry, our operations and products, and those of our customers, are regulated by numerous government agencies, both inside and outside the United States. The impact of this on us is direct, to the extent we are subject to these laws
and regulations, and indirect in that in a number of situations, even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations, our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with
those laws and regulations.







The laws and regulations discussed above
are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial cost associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our sales and marketing practices and may subject us to enforcement actions which
could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Issues with product quality could have an adverse
effect upon our business, subject us to regulatory actions and cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products.

Our success
depends upon the quality of our products. Quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements, preventing defects, improving the company’s products and services and maintaining the integrity of the data
that supports the safety and efficacy of our products. Our future success depends on our ability to maintain and continuously improve our quality management program. While we have one quality system deployed globally that covers the lifecycle of our
products, quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products. A quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture
and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, costly litigation, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. An inability to address a quality or
safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity, a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products, which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products.

Unaffiliated third party suppliers provide a number of goods and services to our R&D, clinical and manufacturing organizations. Third
party suppliers are required to comply with our quality standards. Failure of a third party supplier to provide compliant raw materials or supplies could result in delays, service interruptions or other quality related issues that may negatively
impact our business results. In addition, some of the raw materials employed in our production processes are derived from human and animal origins, requiring robust controls to eliminate the potential for introduction of pathogenic agents or other
contaminants.

For more information on regulatory matters currently affecting us, refer to the discussion under the caption entitled
“Certain Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.







The implementation of healthcare reform in the United States may adversely affect our business.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Act), which was signed into law in March 2010, includes several provisions which
impact the company’s businesses in the United States, including increased Medicaid rebates and an expansion of the 340B Drug Pricing Program which provides certain qualified entities, such as hospitals serving disadvantaged populations, with
discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs and medical devices. In 2011, the company became subject to a tax on the sales of its pharmaceutical products to the government. In 2013, the
company will be required to pay a 2.3% tax on sales of certain of its medical devices. The impact of the increased Medicaid rebates and the expanded 340B Drug Pricing Program is largely expected to impact our BioScience business, while the
additional taxes are expected to impact both of our business segments. We may also experience downward pricing pressure as the Act reduces Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals. While it is intended to expand health insurance coverage and
increase access to medical care generally, the long-term impact of the Act on our business and the demand of our products is uncertain. Similarly, we cannot predict the impact of the additional regulations that need to be established to implement
many of the Act’s provisions.

If reimbursement for our current or future products is reduced or modified in the United States or
abroad, our business could suffer.

Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by
both public and private payors. These payors include Medicare, Medicaid, and private health care insurers in the United States and foreign governments and third-party payors outside the United States. Public and private payors are increasingly
challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. We may continue to experience continued downward pricing pressures from third-party payors which could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operational
results.

Austerity measures or other reforms by foreign governments may limit, reduce or eliminate payments for our products and adversely
affect both our pricing flexibility and demand for our products. Accordingly, reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis. Legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our
products may change at any time and in ways that may be adverse to us.

There is substantial competition in the product markets in which
we operate and in the development of alliances with research, academic and governmental institutions.

Although no single company
competes with us in all of our businesses, we face substantial competition in both of our segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies of all sizes. Competition is primarily focused on cost-effectiveness, price,
service, product performance, and technological innovation. Competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours. If our competitors respond more quickly
to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, our products may be rendered obsolete or non-competitive. If our competitors develop more effective or affordable products, or achieve earlier patent protection or product
commercialization than we do, our operations will likely be negatively affected. If we are forced to reduce our prices due to increased competition, our business could become less profitable. The company’s sales could be adversely affected if
any of its contracts with GPOs, IDNs or other customers are terminated due to increased competition or otherwise.

We also face competition
for marketing, distribution and collaborative development agreements, for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions, and for licenses to intellectual property. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies and
other public and private research organizations may also conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery, research, clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours. These companies and
institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies







complementary to our programs. If we are unable to successfully compete with these companies and institutions, our business may suffer.

The nature of producing plasma-based therapies may prevent us from timely responding to market forces and effectively managing our production capacity.

The production of plasma-based therapies is a lengthy and complex process. Efforts to increase the collection of plasma or the production of plasma-based
therapies may include the construction and regulatory approval of additional plasma collection facilities and/or plasma fractionation facilities, such as the Covington, Georgia facility, the site selection of which we announced in April 2012. The
development of such facilities can be a lengthy regulatory and capital intensive process. As a result, our ability to match our collection and production of plasma-based therapies to market demand is imprecise and may result in a failure to meet the
market demand for our plasma-based therapies or potentially an oversupply of inventory. Failure to meet market demand for our plasma-based therapies may result in customers transitioning to available competitive products resulting in a loss of
segment share or customer confidence. In the event of an oversupply we may be forced to lower the prices we charge for some of our plasma-based therapies, close collection and processing facilities, record asset impairment charges or take other
action which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

If we are unable to obtain sufficient
components or raw materials on a timely basis or if we experience other manufacturing difficulties, our business may be adversely affected.

The manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials. We manufacture our products in more than 50 manufacturing facilities around the
world. We acquire our components and materials from many suppliers in various countries. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful. Further, while efforts
are made to diversify our sources of components and materials, in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier. In addition, due to the regulatory environment in which we operate, we may be unable to quickly establish
additional or replacement sources for some components or materials. A reduction or interruption in supply, and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply, could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or
cost-effective manner, and our ability to make product sales.

Many of our products are difficult to manufacture. This is due to the complex
nature of manufacturing pharmaceuticals, including biologics, and devices, as well as the strict regulatory regime governing our manufacturing operations. Variations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures which could lead to
launch delays, product shortage, unanticipated costs, lost revenues and damage to our reputation. A failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in a quality or safety issue
of the type discussed above.

Several of our products are manufactured at a single manufacturing facility. Loss or damage to a manufacturing
facility due to a natural disaster or otherwise could adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of key products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse
business consequences. Because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility a third party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing capacity due to
natural disaster, regulatory action or otherwise.

If we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights, or if we
infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others, our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged.

Patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce
patents and licenses to patent rights, both in the United States and in other







countries. We cannot guarantee that pending patent applications will result in issued patents, that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, that our
patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent the company from selling certain products or including key features in the company’s products.

The patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Significant litigation concerning
patents and products is pervasive in our industry. Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third
parties. A loss in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products, which could lead to a significant loss of sales, or otherwise materially affect future results of operations.

We also rely on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive positions. Third parties may know,
discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques, or they may gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public. Misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property would have an
adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs.

If our business development
activities are unsuccessful, our business could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely affected.

As part of our
long-term strategy, we are engaged in business development activities including evaluating acquisitions, joint development opportunities, technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities. These activities may result in substantial
investment of the company’s resources. Our success developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition, investment or
alliance; whether we are able to complete an acquisition, investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us; the strength of the other company’s underlying technology, products and ability to execute its business strategies; any
intellectual property and litigation related to these products or technology; and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company, business, product, technology or research into our existing operations, including the ability to adequately
fund acquired in-process research and development projects. If we are unsuccessful in our business development activities, we may be unable to meet our financial targets and our financial performance could be adversely affected.

The proposed acquisition of Gambro AB may adversely affect our financial condition and our business.







impairment charges and other actions which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information on this acquisition, see Note 2 in Item 8
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We are subject to risks associated with doing business globally.

Our operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws, regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and
geographies. These risks include changes in exchange controls and other governmental actions, loss of business in government and public tenders that are held annually in many cases, increasingly complex labor environments, availability of raw
materials, changes in taxation, export control restrictions, changes in or violations of U.S. or local laws, including the FCPA and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, dependence on a few government entities as customers, pricing restrictions,
economic and political instability (including instability as it relates to the Euro), disputes between countries, diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property, and disruption or destruction of operations in a significant geographic
region regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest. Failure to comply with, or material changes to, the laws and regulations that affect our global operations could have an adverse effect on our business,
financial condition or results of operations.

We are subject to foreign currency exchange risk.

We generate the majority of our revenue outside the United States. As a result, our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or our ability to mitigate these risks. A discussion of the financial impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and the ways and extent to
which we attempt to mitigate such impact, including the impact of restrictions on currency exchange imposed by the Venezuelan government, is contained under the caption “Financial Instrument Market Risk” in Item 7 of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities may have a negative impact on our
operating results.

Tax policy reform continues to be a topic of discussion in the United States. A significant change to the tax
system in the United States, including changes to the taxation of international income, could have an adverse effect upon our results of operations. Because we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States,
we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness
of our tax provision. However, we may not accurately predict the outcome of these audits, and as a result the actual outcome of these audits may have an adverse impact on our financial results. For more information on ongoing audits, see Note 12 in
Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We may experience difficulties implementing our new global enterprise resource planning
system.

We are engaged in a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning system (ERP). The ERP is designed
to accurately maintain the company’s books and records and provide information important to the operation of the business to the company’s management team. The company’s ERP will continue to require significant investment of human and
financial resources. In implementing the ERP, we may experience significant delays, increased costs and other difficulties. Any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the ERP could adversely affect our ability to
process orders, ship product, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business. While we have invested significant resources in planning and project management, significant implementation issues may
arise.







We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure.

We increasingly rely upon technology systems and infrastructure. Our technology systems are potentially vulnerable to breakdown or
other interruption by fire, power loss, system malfunction, unauthorized access and other events. Likewise, data privacy breaches by employees and others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to
unauthorized persons or to the public. While we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology and in related training, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent significant breakdowns, breaches in our
systems or other cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect upon our reputation, business, operations or financial condition of the company. In addition, significant implementation issues may arise as we continue to consolidate and
outsource certain computer operations and application support activities.

If we fail to attract and retain key employees our business
may suffer.

Our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees, including people in senior
management, sales, marketing and research positions. Competition for top talent in healthcare can be intense. Our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors, including hiring practices of our competitors,
compensation and benefits, work location, work environment and industry economic conditions. If we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified employees, our business could suffer.

We are subject to a number of pending lawsuits.

We are a defendant in a number of
pending lawsuits. In addition, we may be named as a defendant in future patent, product liability or other lawsuits. These current and future matters may result in a loss of patent protection, reduced revenue, significant liabilities and diversion
of our management’s time, attention and resources. Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these current matters.
In view of these uncertainties, the outcome of these matters may result in charges in excess of any established reserves, and, to the extent available, liability insurance. We also continue to be self-insured with respect to product liability
claims. The absence of third-party insurance coverage for current or future claims increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions. Protracted litigation, including any adverse outcomes, may have an adverse impact on
the business, operations or financial condition of the company. Even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees. See Note 13 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K
for more information regarding current lawsuits.

Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and
financial condition.
