Item 1A.  Risk Factors

﻿

We operate in rapidly changing economic, political,and technological environments that present numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict.  Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows,our ability to successfully execute our strategy and capital allocation framework,and the trading price of our common stock or debt.  The following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance.  This information should be read in conjunction with MD&A and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report.  The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider, as these factors could cause our future results to differ from those inourforward-looking statements and from historical trends.

﻿

As a global company, we face many risks which could adversely impact our operations and reported financial results

﻿

We are a global company and derive a substantial portion of our revenues from, and have significant operations, outside of the United States.  Our international operations include manufacturing, assembly, sales, research and development, customer support, and shared administrative service centers.

Compliance with laws and regulations increases our costs.We are subject to bothU.S. laws and local laws which, among other things,include data privacy requirements, employment and labor laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, prohibitions on payments to governmental officials, import and trade restrictions and export requirements.  Non-compliance or violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business.  Such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results.  Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and manage these risks.

﻿

We are also subject to a variety of other risks in managing a global organization, including those related to:

﻿

·The economicand politicalconditions in each country or region;

·Complex regulatory requirements affecting international trade and investment, including anti-dumping laws, export controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting improper payments.  Our operations may be adversely affected by changes in the substance or enforcement of these regulatory requirements, and by actual or alleged violations of them;

·Fluctuations in currency exchange rates, convertibility of currencies and restrictions involving the movement of funds between jurisdictions and countries;

·Governmental protectionist policies and sovereign and political risks that may adversely affect Corning’s profitability and assets;

·Tariffs, trade duties and other trade barriers including anti-dumping duties;

·Geographical concentration of our factories and operations,and regional shifts in our customer base;

·Periodic health epidemic concerns;

·Political unrest, confiscation or expropriation of our assets by foreign governments, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities;

·Difficulty in protecting intellectual property, sensitive commercial and operations data, and information technology systems;

·Differing legal systems, including protection and treatment of intellectual property and patents;

·Complex, or competingtax regimes;

·Difficulty in collecting obligations owed to us;

·Natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, tsunamis and windstorms; and

·Potentialloss of utilitiesorotherdisruption affecting manufacturing.

﻿

Corning’s Display Technologies segmentgenerates a significant amount of the Company’s profits and cash flow.  Anysignificant decrease in LCD glass pricingcould have a material and negative impact on our financial results

﻿

Corning’s ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely upon the profitability of ourLCD glass business, which is subject to continuouspricing pressuredue tointenseindustrycompetition, potential over-capacity, anddevelopment of newtechnologies.If we are notable to achieve proportionate reductions in costs or sustain our current rate of cost reduction to offsetpotentialpricing pressures itcould have a materialadverseimpact on our financial results.

﻿

Because we have a concentrated customer base in each of our businesses, our sales could be negatively impacted by the actionsor insolvencyof one or more key customers, as well as our ability to retain these customers

﻿

A relatively small number of customers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in our reportable segments.Mergers and consolidations between customerscould result infurther concentration ofCorning’s customer base.If further concentration occurs or a key customer becomes insolvent, the loss of a key customer could result in a substantial loss of sales and reduction in anticipated in cash flows.  Unforeseen events or actions on the part of Corning could also result in the loss of customers, resulting in further customer concentration.

﻿

Business disruptions could affect our operating results

﻿

A major earthquake, fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption ofany of our critical facilities could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future financial results could be materially and adversely affected.For example, certain manufacturing sites require high quality, continuous, and uninterrupted power and access to industrial water.  Unplanned outages could have a material negative impact on our operations and ability to supply our customers.

﻿

Additionally, a significant amount of the specialized manufacturing capacity for ourreportablesegmentsis concentrated insingle-site locationsand it is reasonably possible that the operations of one or more such facilities could be disrupted.  Due to the specialized nature of the assets, it may not be possible to find replacement capacity quickly or substitute production fromotherfacilities.  Accordingly,a disruption at a single-site manufacturing operation could significantly impact Corning’s ability to supply its customers andcould produce a near-term severe impacton ourindividualbusinessesand the Company as a whole.

﻿

Geopolitical events, as well as other events outside of Corning’s control, could cause a disruption to our manufacturing operations and adversely impact our customers, resulting in a negative impact to Corning’s net sales, net income, asset values and liquidity.

﻿

A natural disaster, epidemic, labor strike, war or political unrest may adversely affect Corning's ability to supply our customers and impact the value of our assets.  Such events may also impact our customers’ facilities and reduce our sales to such customers. For example, a sizeable portion of Corning’s glass manufacturing capacity is located in South Korea and we generate a significant portion of our sales through two South Korean customers.  Deterioration of the geopolitical climate in such a region could cause a disruption to our manufacturing operations and adversely impact our customers, resulting in a negative impact to Corning’s net sales, net income, asset values and liquidity.

﻿

We may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights, which could result in loss of market share, and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others

﻿

We rely on patent and trade secret laws, copyright, trademark, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights.  Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited and we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses.  We cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors.  Changes in or enforcement of laws concerning intellectual property, worldwide, may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of, or the unauthorized use of, our intellectual property, potentially resulting in loss of market share.  Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights.  Litigation is inherently uncertain and outcomes are often unpredictable.  If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive.

﻿

The intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products.  Other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand, enforce and license their patent portfolios.  We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by third parties claiming infringement, misappropriation or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them.  These third parties often include entities that do not have the capabilities to design, manufacture, or distribute products or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse.  Such claims of infringement or misappropriation may result in loss of revenue, substantial costs, or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us.

Information technology dependency andcybersecurity vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, liability claims, or competitive harm

﻿

The Company is dependent on information technology (“IT”)systemsand infrastructurefor its business and manufacturing controls.Our IT systems may be vulnerable to disruptions fromhuman error, outdated applications,computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions.Any significantdisruption,breakdown, intrusion, interruption or corruption of these systems or data breaches couldcause theloss of data, equipment damage, downtime, and/or safety related issues and couldhave a material adverse effect on our business.  Like other global companies, we have, from time to time, experienced incidents related to ourITsystems, and expect that such incidents will continue, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and disruptions.  We have measures and defenses in place against unauthorized access, but we may not be able to prevent, immediately detect, or remediate such events.A material breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets.  Such disruptions or security breaches could result in the theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information, harm our competitive position,disrupt our manufacturing,reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, or otherwise adversely affect our business.

﻿

Additionally,we believe thatutilities and other operators of critical infrastructure that serve our facilities face heightened security risks, including cyber-attack.  In the event of such an attack, disruption in service from our utility providers could disrupt our manufacturing operations which rely on a continuous source of power (electrical, gas, etc.).

﻿

We may notearn a positive returnfrom our research,developmentand engineering investments

﻿

Developing our products throughour innovation model ofresearch and development is expensive and often involves a long investment cycle.  We make significantexpenditures andinvestments in research and developmentand four process engineering platforms that may earn an economic return.If our investments do not provide a pipeline of new technologies that our customers demand or lower cost manufacturing platforms, it could negatively impact our revenues and operating margins both near- and long-term.

﻿

We have significant exposure to foreign currency movements

﻿

A large portion of our sales, profit and cash flows are transacted in non-U.S. dollar currencies and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to these exposures.  We will experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or cost effective to hedge our currency exposures or should we elect not to hedge certain currency exposures.  Alternatively, we may experience gains or losses if the underlying exposure which we have hedged change (increases or decreases) and we are unable to reverse, unwind, or terminate the hedges concurrent with the change in the underlying notional exposure.

﻿

Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we have, the exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have entered into foreign currency contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.  Our hedge portfolio may reduce our flexibility to respond to price moves by our Display Technologies segment competitors.

﻿

Foreign currency movements may also impact our competitive cost position relative to our largest, Japan-based competitors in the Display Technologies segment.  The profitability of customers may also be impacted as they typically purchase from us in Japanese yen and they sell in various currencies.

﻿

All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations, anticipated future results, financial position and cash flows, the timing of which is variable and generally outside of our control.

﻿

We have significant exposure to counterparties of our related derivatives portfolio

﻿

We maintain a significant portfolio of over the counter derivatives to hedge our projected currency exposure to the Japanese yen, New Taiwan dollar, South Korean won, Chinese yuan and euro.  Weare exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts.Any failure of a counterparty to pay on such a contract when due could materially impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Ifwe are unable to obtain certain specialized equipment, raw and batch materials or natural resources required inour productsor processes, our business will suffer

﻿

Our ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery ofequipment,parts and components from our suppliers.We may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations.  There can be no assurances that we will not encounter problems in the future.  Certain manufacturing equipmentandcomponents are available only from single or limited sources, and wemay not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner.  A reduction, interruption or delay of supply, or a significant increase in the price for supplies, such as manufacturing equipment, precious metals, raw materials, utilities includingenergyand industrial water, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.

﻿

We use specialized raw materials from single-source suppliers (e.g., specific mines or quarries) and natural resources (e.g., helium) in certain products and processes.  If a supplier is unable to provide the required raw materials or the natural resource is in scarce supply or not readily available, we may be unable to change our product composition or manufacturing process in order to prevent a disruption to our business.

﻿

We have incurred, and may in the future incur, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges

﻿

AtDecember31,2017, Corning had goodwill and other intangible assets ofapproximately$2.6billion.  While we believe the estimates and judgments about future cash flows used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable, we cannot provide assurance that additional impairment charges in the future will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur, especially if an economic recession occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes severe, or if acquisitions and investments made by the Company fail to achieve expected returns.

﻿

Changes in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operations

﻿

Our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted by several factors, including:

﻿

·Changes in the relative amounts of income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;

·Changes in tax laws, tax treaties and regulations or the interpretation of them,including the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”) passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law onDecember22, 2017;

·Changes to our assessment about the realizability of our deferred tax assets that are based on estimates of our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economicand politicalenvironments in which we do business;

·The outcome of current and future tax audits, examinations, or administrative appeals;

·Changes in generally accepted accounting principles that affect the accounting for taxes; and

·Limitations or adverse findings regarding our ability to do business in some jurisdictions.

﻿

We may have additional tax liabilities

﻿

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions and are commonly audited by various tax authorities.  In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.  Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.  Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, thefinal determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.  The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.

﻿

The recent 2017 Tax Act could significantly impact how U.S. global corporations are taxed.  We are in the process of evaluating the impact of this new legislation and certainchangescould have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow.  Among other things, the 2017 Tax Act requires companies to pay a one-time mandatory tax on unrepatriated earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred (the “toll charge”) and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings.  The toll charge resulted in an additional $1.1billionprovisional tax expense.However, settlement of the toll charge will occur almost entirely throughthe useof existingforeigntaxcredit carryovers of $1.1billion.

﻿

Our innovation model depends on ourability to attract andretain specialized experts in ourcore technologies

﻿

Our innovation model requires us to employ highly specialized experts in glass science, ceramic science, and optical physics to conduct our research and development and engineer our products and design our manufacturing facilities.The loss of the services of any member of our key research and development or engineeringteamwithout adequate replacement, or the inability to attract new qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.

We are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions that interrupt our operations

﻿

Some of our manufacturing processes generate chemical waste, waste water, other industrial waste or greenhouse gases, and we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of such substances.  We have installed anti-pollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and waste water at our facilities.  We have taken steps to control the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations.  However, we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that government regulators will not take steps to adopt more stringent environmental standards.

﻿

Any failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us, or the suspension/cessation of production or operations.  In addition, environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment, incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.

﻿

Changes in regulations and the regulatory environment in the U.S. and other countries, such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and CO2abatement, may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by, among other things, substantially increasing manufacturing costs, limiting availability of scarce resources, especially energy, or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers.

﻿

Current or future litigation or regulatory investigations may harm our financial condition or results of operations

﻿

As a global technology and manufacturing company, we are engaged invariouslitigation and regulatory matters.  Litigation and regulatory proceedings may be uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, resulting in significant liabilities, penalties or damages.  Such current or future substantial legal liabilities or regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.

﻿

Our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations



Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Anti-boycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries.  Any alleged or actual violationby an employee or the Companymay subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States.  We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.

﻿

In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage.  Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws.  Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of alleged violations.  Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.

﻿

Moreover, several of our related partners are domiciled in areas of the world with laws, rules and business practices that differ from those in the United States, and we face the reputational and legal risk that our related partners may violate applicable laws, rules and business practices.

International trade policies maynegativelyimpactour ability to sell and manufacture our products outside of the U.S.



Government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas,tariffs, andcapital controls, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us (including our equity affiliates/joint ventures) from being able to selland/or manufactureproducts in certain countries.  The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, in countries in which we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  For example, a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations.  These policies also affect our equity companies.
