Item 1A. Risk Factors

In evaluating our business, the risks described below, as well as other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC should be considered carefully. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business. The occurrence of any of these events or circumstances could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flow or results of operations. This report contains forward-looking statements; please refer to the cautionary statements made under the heading "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" for more information on the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements.

THE COVID-19 GLOBAL PANDEMIC

We may not realize anticipated revenue from our COVID-19 diagnostic assays.

We have developed assays to detect the novel strain of coronavirus, which causes the infectious disease known as COVID-19 ("COVID-19"). While we have seen significant demand for our COVID-19 assays, other companies are working to





produce or have produced tests for COVID-19 which may lead to the diversion of customers, including governmental and quasi-governmental entities, away from us and toward other companies. Moreover, the dangers posed by COVID-19 may subside over time. We expect that, if and when the current COVID-19 pandemic subsides, there may be a significantly reduced demand for ongoing testing, and thus, for our COVID-19 assays. There is no guarantee that current or anticipated demand will continue, or if demand does continue, that we will be able to produce in quantities to meet the demand. A significant decline in demand for our COVID-19 assays without a corresponding uptick in our other businesses could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow and financial position.

Additional resources allocated to our Diagnostics business may negatively impact our other development programs or production capacities.

Given the significant current demand for our COVID-19 assays as well as for our Panther systems on which the assays run, we have devoted significant financial resources and personnel to scaling up production of the assay and our Panther systems. This resource allocation may cause delays in or otherwise negatively impact our other development programs or production capacities. Our business could be negatively impacted by our allocation of significant resources to a global health threat that is unpredictable and that could dissipate.

The COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic disruptions have adversely affected and could in the future continue to have a material adverse impact on the demand for many of our products.

The COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic disruptions could have a material adverse effect on manufacturing, distribution and supply chain.

The COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic disruptions could have an adverse impact on our manufacturing capacity, supply chains and distribution systems, including as a result of impacts associated with preventive and precautionary measures that we, other businesses and governments are taking. Although we have not experienced significant manufacturing or supply chain difficulties as a result of COVID-19, we may in the future. A reduction or interruption in any of our manufacturing processes could have a material adverse effect on our business.

GLOBAL CHALLENGES

Continuing worldwide political and social uncertainty, as well as existing tariffs and trade wars and social tensions, may adversely affect our business and prospects, both domestically and internationally.

Political and social uncertainty and divisions are rife in the U.S. and throughout the world, impairing political, trade and economic relations worldwide. This impacts how we are able to do business and expand our global footprint. Changes in policy in the U.S. and other countries regarding international trade, including import and export regulation and international trade agreements, could negatively impact our business. In 2018, 2019 and 2020, the U.S. imposed tariffs on goods imported from China and certain other countries, which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by China and other countries. Additional tariffs or further retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response, could affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products, prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, could negatively impact our business, results of operations and





financial condition. There is also uncertainty surrounding the impact of U.S. presidential and congressional elections in 2020 on existing and future healthcare legislation; changes in such legislation could have a material adverse impact on our business.

Our international operations and foreign acquisitions expose us to additional operational challenges that we might not otherwise face.

International expansion is a key component of our growth strategy. In fiscal 2020, 24.2% of our revenue came from outside of the U.S. As we grow internationally, our future and existing international operations may subject us to a number of additional risks and expenses, any of which could harm our operating results. These risks and expenses include:

•political and economic changes and disruptions, export/import controls and tariff regulations;

•difficulties in developing staffing and simultaneously managing operations in multiple locations as a result of, among other things, distance, language and cultural differences;

•governmental currency controls;

•multiple, conflicting and changing government laws and regulations (including, among other things, antitrust and tax requirements);

•protectionist laws and business practices that favor local companies;

•difficulties in the collection of trade accounts receivable;

•difficulties and expenses related to implementing internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures;

•expenses associated with customizing products for clients in foreign countries;

•possible adverse tax consequences;

•the inability to obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals or favorable third-party reimbursement;

•operation in parts of the world where strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices;

•the inability to effectively obtain, maintain, protect or enforce intellectual property rights, reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries, and the inability to otherwise protect against clone or “knock off” products;

•the lack of ability to enforce non-compete agreements with former owners of acquired businesses competing with us in China and other foreign countries; and

•lower margins on a number of our products sold outside of the U.S.

BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES

Supply Chain and Manufacturing

Our reliance on one third-party manufacturer for certain of our product lines and a limited number of suppliers for some key raw materials, components and subassemblies for our products exposes us to increased risks associated with production delays, delivery schedules, manufacturing capability, quality control, quality assurance and costs.

We may in the future need to find new contract manufacturers or suppliers to replace existing manufacturers or suppliers, increase our volumes or reduce our costs. We may not be able to find contract manufacturers or suppliers that meet our needs,





including regulatory requirements, and even if we do, the process of qualifying such alternative manufacturers and suppliers is often expensive and time consuming. As a result, we may lose revenues and our customer relationships may suffer.

Interruptions, delays, shutdowns or damage at our manufacturing facilities could harm our business.

In most cases, the manufacturing of each of our products is concentrated in one or a few locations. An interruption in manufacturing capabilities at any of these facilities, as a result of equipment failure, disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, or other reasons, could reduce, delay or prevent the production of our products. Our manufacturing facilities and those of our contract manufacturers or suppliers are subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events, such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods or weather conditions. Manufacturing facilities may experience plant shutdowns, strikes or other labor disruptions, or periods of reduced production as a result of equipment failures, loss of power, gray outs, delays in deliveries or extensive damage, which could harm our business and prospects. Some of our manufacturing operations are located outside the U.S., including in Costa Rica and the United Kingdom. Those manufacturing operations are also subject to additional challenges and risks associated with international operations described herein.

Customer Concentration and Distributors

Our Diagnostics segment depends on a small number of customers for a significant portion of its product sales, the loss of any of these customers or any cancellation or delay of a large purchase by any of these customers could significantly reduce revenues in our Diagnostics segment.

Although we do not currently have any customers that represent more than 10% of our consolidated revenues, a material portion of product sales in our Diagnostics segment comes from (and we anticipate will continue to come from) a limited number of customers, two of which accounted for 12.5% and 10.9% of our Diagnostics segment revenue in fiscal 2020. The loss of any of these key customers, or a significant reduction in sales volume or pricing to these customers, could significantly reduce our Diagnostics segment revenues or profitability.

We utilize distributors for a portion of our sales, the loss of which could harm our revenues in the territory serviced by these distributors.

We rely on strategic relationships with a number of key distributors for sales and service of our products. If any of our strategic relationships terminate without replacement or if our strategic partners fail to perform their contractual obligations, our revenues and/or ability to service our products in the territories serviced by these distributors could be adversely affected. We do not control our distributors, and these parties may not be successful in marketing our products. These parties may fail to commit the necessary resources to market and sell our products to the level of our expectations.

If we elect to distribute new products directly, we will have to invest in additional sales and marketing resources, including additional field sales personnel, which would significantly increase future selling, general and administrative expenses. If we fail to successfully market our products, our product sales will decrease. We may also be exposed to risks as a result of transitioning a territory from a distributor sales model to a direct sales model, such as difficulties maintaining relationships with specific customers, hiring appropriately trained personnel or ensuring compliance with local product registration requirements, any of which could result in lower revenues than previously received from the distributor in that territory.

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND COMPETITION

Our long-term success will depend upon our ability to execute on business development activities and integrate acquired businesses.





operating results and financial condition. If we spend significant funds or incur additional debt or other obligations, our ability to obtain financing for working capital or other purposes could be adversely affected, and we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures. If we fail to identify, acquire and integrate complementary businesses and products, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition could be adversely affected.

We face intense competition from other companies and may not be able to compete successfully.

The markets in which we sell our products are intensely competitive, subject to rapid technological change and may be significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants, and these competitive pressures may reduce the demand and prices for our products. Other companies may develop products that are superior to and/or less expensive than our products. Improvements in existing competitive products or the introduction of new competitive products may reduce our ability to compete for sales, particularly if those competitive products demonstrate better safety or effectiveness, clinical results, ease of use or lower costs.

Some companies may have significant competitive advantages over us, which may make them more attractive to hospitals, clinics, radiology clients, group purchasing organizations, laboratories, and physicians, including:

•greater brand recognition;

•larger or more established distribution networks and customer bases;

•a broader product portfolio, resulting in the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer discounts or incentives to gain a competitive advantage;

•higher levels of automation and greater installed bases of such equipment;

•more extensive research, development, sales, marketing, and manufacturing capabilities and greater financial resources; and

•greater technical resources positioning them to continue to improve their technology in order to compete in an evolving industry.

Challenges in the development of our products could materially impact our long-term success.

Our growth depends in large part on our ability to identify and develop new products or new indications for or enhancements of existing products. The development of new products and enhancement of existing products requires significant investment in research and development, clinical trials and regulatory approvals. The results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to anticipate customer needs, innovate and develop new products, complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory clearances and approvals and reimbursement in the U.S. and abroad, manufacture products in a cost-effective manner, obtain, maintain, protect and enforce appropriate intellectual property protection for our products, gain and maintain market approval of our products and access capital. If we are not able to successfully enhance existing products or develop new products, our products may be rendered obsolete or uncompetitive by changing technology or new industry standards. We cannot assure that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance, and we may be unable to recover all or a meaningful part of our investment in such products and technologies.

The markets for our newly developed products and newly introduced enhancements to our existing products may not develop as expected.

The successful commercialization of our newly developed products and newly introduced enhancements to our existing products are subject to numerous risks, both known and unknown, including:

•uncertainty of the development of a market for such product;

•trends relating to, or the introduction or existence of, competing products or technologies that may be more effective, safer or easier to use than our products or technologies;

•the perception of our products as compared to other products;

•recommendation and support for the use of our products by influential customers, such as highly regarded hospitals, physicians and treatment centers;

•the availability and extent of data demonstrating the clinical efficacy of our products or treatments;

•competition, including the presence of competing products sold by companies with longer operating histories, more recognizable names and more established distribution networks; and

•other technological developments.

Often, the development of a significant market for a product will depend upon the establishment of a reimbursement code or an advantageous reimbursement level for use of the product. Moreover, even if addressed, such reimbursement codes or levels frequently are not established until after a product is developed and commercially introduced, which can delay the successful commercialization of a product. If we are unable to successfully commercialize and create a significant market for





our newly developed products and newly introduced enhancements to our existing products our business and prospects could be harmed.

If we cannot maintain our current corporate collaborations and enter into new corporate collaborations, our product development could be delayed and our revenue could be adversely impacted.

We have relied and/or expect to rely on corporate collaborators for funding development, marketing, distribution, and the commercialization of certain products. If any of our corporate collaborators were to breach, terminate, fail to renew our agreements or otherwise fail to properly conduct its obligations in a timely manner, the development or commercialization and subsequent marketing of the products contemplated by the collaboration could be delayed or terminated. Further, we would be required to devote additional resources to product development or marketing, to terminate some development programs or to seek alternative corporate collaborations. Any corporate collaboration may divert management time and resources. In some instances, we have entered into corporate collaborations with certain partners or companies that could make it more difficult for us to enter into advantageous business transactions or relationships with others. Any of the foregoing risks could harm our business and prospects.

THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT AND GUIDELINES

Healthcare cost containment legislation and the failure of third-party payors to provide appropriate levels of coverage and reimbursement for the use of products and treatments facilitated by our products could harm our business and prospects.

Sales and market acceptance of our diagnostics, breast and skeletal health and surgical products and the treatments facilitated by these products are dependent upon the coverage decisions and reimbursement policies established by government healthcare programs and private health insurers. These policies affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Reimbursement varies by country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new products and technologies. Even if we develop a promising new product, we may find limited demand for the product unless appropriate reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental third-party payors. Further legislative or administrative reforms to the reimbursement systems in the U.S. and other countries in a manner that significantly reduces reimbursement for procedures using our diagnostics, breast and skeletal health and surgical products or denies coverage for those procedures facilitated by our products, including price regulation, competitive bidding and tendering, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Guidelines, recommendations and studies published by various organizations may reduce the use of our products.

CYBERSECURITY AND DATA PRIVACY

Increased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions, services and data.

Increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats, computer viruses and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks, as well as cybersecurity failures resulting from human error and technological errors, pose a risk to the security of Hologic and its customers, business partners' and suppliers' products, systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data on these products, systems and networks. As the perpetrators of such attacks become more capable, and as critical infrastructure is increasingly becoming digitized, the risks in this area continue to grow. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, monitoring and testing, and maintenance of protective systems and contingency plans, we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats, and we





cannot assure that the impact from such threats will not be material. In addition to existing risks, the adoption of new technologies may also increase our exposure to cybersecurity breaches and failures. Additionally, we have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations or customer-imposed controls. Despite our implementation of controls to protect our systems and sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, we may be vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, misplaced, lost or corrupted data, employee errors and/or malfeasance (including misappropriation by departing employees) that could potentially lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions. In addition, a cyber-related attack could result in other negative consequences, including damage to our reputation or competitiveness, remediation or increased protection costs, litigation or regulatory action. Although we have experienced occasional actual or attempted breaches of our computer systems, to date we do not believe any of these breaches has had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation.

Failure to comply with laws relating to the confidentiality of sensitive personal information or standards related to the transmission of electronic health data, may require us to make significant changes to our products, or incur penalties or other liabilities.

REGULATORY AND LEGAL

We operate in a highly regulated industry, and changes in healthcare laws and regulations or our inability to obtain in a timely manner or at all U.S. or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for our current and newly developed products or product enhancements, could adversely affect our business and prospects.

We operate in a highly regulated industry. As a result, governmental actions may adversely affect our business, operations or financial condition, including:

•new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to healthcare availability, method of delivery and payment for healthcare products and services;

•changes in the FDA and foreign regulatory approval processes that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and result in lost market opportunity;

•changes in FDA and foreign regulations that may require additional safety monitoring, labeling changes, restrictions on product distribution or use, or other measures after the introduction of our products to market, which could increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the future permitted uses of approved products, or otherwise adversely affect the market for our products; and

•new laws, regulations and judicial decisions affecting pricing or marketing practices.

Given the high level of regulatory oversight to which our products are subject, the process of obtaining clearances and approvals can be costly and time consuming. In addition, there is a risk that any approvals or clearances, once obtained, may be withdrawn. Most medical devices cannot be marketed in the U.S. without 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval by the FDA. Any modifications to a device that has received a pre-market approval that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device require a pre-market approval supplement or possibly a separate pre-market approval, either of which is likely to be time





consuming, expensive and uncertain to obtain. If the FDA requires us to seek one or more pre-market approval supplements or new pre-market approvals for any modification to a previously approved device, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified device until we obtain approval, and we may be subject to significant criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, but not limited to, regulatory fines or penalties. States may also regulate the manufacture, sale and use of medical devices, particularly those that employ x-ray technology.

Our products are also subject to approval and regulation by foreign regulatory and safety agencies. For example, the EU has adopted the EU Medical Device Regulation (the “EU MDR”) and the In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (the “EU IVDR”), each of which impose stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance. Manufacturers of currently approved medical devices will have until May 2021 to meet the requirements of the EU MDR and until May 2022 to meet the EU IVDR. Complying with the requirements of these regulations may require us to incur significant expenditures. Failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to the EU requirements.

We anticipate that governmental authorities will continue to scrutinize the healthcare industry closely and that changes in laws, regulations or policies by governmental authorities may cause increased uncertainties and compliance costs, exposure to litigation and other adverse effects to our business and operations. Delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain or maintain, clearances or approvals for future products could delay or preclude realization of product revenues from new or existing products or result in substantial additional costs which could decrease our profitability.

In addition, maintaining compliance with multiple regulators, and multiple centers within the FDA, adds complexity and cost to our manufacturing processes. Our manufacturing facilities and those of our contract manufacturers are subject to periodic regulatory inspections by the FDA and other regulatory agencies, and these facilities are subject to the FDA's Quality System Regulation and Good Manufacturing Practices. We or our contractors may fail to satisfy these regulatory requirements in the future, and any failure to do so may prevent us from selling our products.

Some of our activities may subject us to risks under federal and state laws prohibiting “kickbacks” and false or fraudulent claims.





We are subject to the risk of product liability claims relating to our products for which we may not have adequate insurance.

Our business involves the risk of product liability and other claims inherent to the medical device business. If even one of our products is found to have caused or contributed to injuries or deaths, we could be held liable for substantial damages. We maintain product liability insurance subject to deductibles and exclusions. There is a risk that the insurance coverage will not be sufficient to protect us from product and other liability claims, or that product liability insurance will not be available to us at a reasonable cost, if at all. An under-insured or uninsured claim could harm our business and prospects. In addition, claims could adversely affect the reputation of the related product, which could damage that product’s competitive position in the market.

The sale and use of our diagnostic products could also lead to product liability claims if someone were to allege that one of our products contained a design or manufacturing defect that resulted in inaccurate test results or the failure to detect a disorder for which it was being used to screen, or caused injuries to a patient. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in an increase in our product liability insurance rates or the inability to secure additional coverage in the future. Also, even a meritless or unsuccessful product liability claim could be time consuming and expensive to defend. This could result in a diversion of management’s attention from our business and adversely affect the perceived safety and efficacy of our products, which could harm our business and prospects.

We are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including related to our use and recycling of hazardous materials and the composition of our products.

Changes in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Company’s operating results.

We are subject to income taxes, as well as taxes that are not income-based, in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions, and tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. Our future effective tax rate could be unfavorably affected by numerous factors including a change in, or the interpretation of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, a change in our geographic earnings mix, or a change in the measurement of our deferred taxes.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Our business is dependent on technologies we license, and if we fail to maintain these licenses or license new technologies and rights to particular nucleic acid sequences for targeted diseases in the future, we may be limited in our ability to develop new products.

Our business is dependent on licenses from third parties for some of our key technologies. For example, our patented TMA technology is based on technology we licensed from Stanford University. We anticipate that we will enter into new licensing arrangements in the ordinary course of business to expand our product portfolio and access new technologies to enhance our products and develop new products. Many of these licenses will provide us with exclusive rights to the subject technology or disease marker. If our license with respect to any of these technologies or markers is terminated for any reason, we may not be able to sell products that incorporate that technology. Similarly, we may lose competitive advantages if we fail to maintain exclusivity under an exclusive license.





Our ability to develop additional diagnostic tests for diseases may depend on the ability of third parties to discover particular sequences or markers and correlate them with disease, as well as the rate at which such discoveries are made. Our ability to design products that target these diseases may depend on our ability to obtain the necessary rights from the third parties that make any of these discoveries. In addition, there are a finite number of diseases and conditions for which our NAT diagnostic assays may be economically viable. If we are unable to access new technologies or the rights to particular sequences or markers necessary for additional diagnostic products on commercially reasonable terms, we may be limited in our ability to develop new diagnostic products.

Our products and manufacturing processes may require access to technologies and materials that may be subject to patents or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. Our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain the additional intellectual property rights necessary to commercialize our products.

Our business could be harmed if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology.

Our business could be harmed if we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.

There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device, diagnostic products and related industries. We are and have been involved in patent litigation and may in the future be subject to further claims of infringement of intellectual property rights possessed by third parties. In connection with claims of patent infringement, we may seek to enter into settlement and/or licensing arrangements. There is a risk in these situations that no license will be available or that a license will not be available on reasonable terms. Alternatively, we may decide to litigate such claims or to design around the COVID-19 assays technology. These actions could be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. As a result, any infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by customers resulting from infringement claims, whether or not proven to be true, may harm our business and prospects.

INDEBTEDNESS

We have a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding, which limits our operating flexibility, and could adversely affect our operations and financial results and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.

As of September 26, 2020, we had approximately $3.0 billion aggregate principal of indebtedness outstanding (exclusive of an additional $1.25 billion that would be available to draw under our revolver and any funds that we may draw under our temporarily suspended accounts receivable securitization program). We also have other contractual obligations and deferred tax liabilities, which as of September 26, 2020, are described under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Contractual Obligations.” This significant level of indebtedness and our other obligations may:

•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness;

•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including increases in interest rates;

•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts, strategic transactions and other general corporate purposes;

•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we participate;





•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and

•limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts, strategic transactions or other general corporate purposes.

In addition, the terms of our financing obligations contain certain covenants that restrict our ability, and that of our subsidiaries, to engage in certain transactions and may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions, including, among other things, limitations on our ability to:

•incur indebtedness or issue certain preferred equity;

•pay dividends, repurchase our common stock, or make other distributions or restricted payments;

•make certain investments;

•agree to payment restrictions affecting the restricted subsidiaries;

•sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of assets, including equity interests of our subsidiaries;

•enter into transactions with our affiliates;

•create liens;

•designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries;

•consolidate, merge or sell substantially all of our assets; and

•use the proceeds of permitted sales of our assets.

Our amended and restated credit facilities also require us to satisfy certain financial covenants. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by general economic conditions, political decisions, industry conditions and other events beyond our control. Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in our amended and restated credit facilities, including financial covenants, could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

If there were an event of default under one of our debt instruments or a change of control, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately and may be cross-defaulted to other debt, including our outstanding notes. Our assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default or a change of control, and there is no guarantee that we would be able to repay, refinance or restructure the payments on such debt. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service all of our indebtedness and other obligations.

A significant portion of our indebtedness is subject to floating interest rates, which may expose us to higher interest payments.

A significant portion of our indebtedness is subject to floating interest rates, which makes us more vulnerable in the event of adverse economic conditions, increases in prevailing interest rates, or a downturn in our business. As of September 26, 2020, approximately $1.7 billion aggregate principal of our indebtedness, which represented the outstanding principal under our Amended and Restated Credit Facilities, was subject to floating interest rates. We currently have limited hedging arrangements in place to mitigate the impact of higher interest rates, including interest rate cap agreements and an interest rate swap agreement. These interest rate cap agreements expire through December 23, 2020, and the interest rate swap contract expires on December 17, 2023. We may not be able to extend these at an attractive economic price.

The proposed discontinuation or replacement of LIBOR would require us to amend certain agreements and may otherwise adversely affect our business.





The UK Financial Conduct Authority announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. Changes in the method of calculating LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative rate or benchmark, may adversely affect interest rates and result in higher borrowing costs. This could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. If changes are made to the method of calculating LIBOR or LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to amend certain contracts, including our Credit Agreement and related interest rate swap agreements, and we cannot predict what alternative rate or benchmark would be negotiated. This may result in an increase to our interest expense.

GENERAL RISK FACTORS

Our success depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain key personnel and plan for future executive transitions.

Provisions in our charter, bylaws, and indebtedness may have the effect of discouraging advantageous offers for our business or common stock and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.

Our charter, bylaws, and the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law include provisions that may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change of control. Our indebtedness also contains provisions which either accelerate or require us to offer to repurchase the indebtedness at a premium upon a change of control. These provisions could limit the price that our stockholders might receive in the future for shares of our common stock.

Our stock price is volatile.

The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. We believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:

•new, or changes in, recommendations, guidelines or studies that could affect the use of our products;

•announcements and rumors of developments related to our business, including changes in reimbursement rates or regulatory requirements, proposed and completed acquisitions, or the industry in which we compete;

•published studies and reports relating to the comparative efficacy of products and markets in which we participate;

•quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results and order levels;

•general conditions in the U.S. or worldwide economy;

•our stock repurchase program;

•announcements of technological innovations;

•new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;

•developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation;

•developments in relationships with our customers and suppliers;

•the implementation of healthcare reform legislation and the adoption of additional reform legislation in the future; and

•the success or lack of success of integrating our acquisitions.

In addition, the stock market in general and the markets for shares of “high-tech” and life sciences companies, have historically experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. Any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and the market price of our common stock may decline.
