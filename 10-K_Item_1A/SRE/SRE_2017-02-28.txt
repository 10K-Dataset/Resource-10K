ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

When evaluating our company and its subsidiaries, you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this report. These risk factors could materially adversely affect our actual results and cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. We may also be materially harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial. If any of the following occurs, our businesses, cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects could be materially negatively impacted. In addition, the trading prices of our securities and those of our subsidiaries could substantially decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other detailed information concerning



our company set forth in the Annual Report, including, without limitation, the information set forth in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” In this section, when we state that a risk or uncertainty may, could or will have a “material adverse effect” on us or may, could or will “materially adversely affect” us, we mean that the risk or uncertainty may, could or will, as the case may be, have a material adverse effect on our businesses, cash flows, results of operations, financial condition, prospects and/or the trading prices of our securities or those of our subsidiaries.

Sempra Energy’s cash flows, ability to pay dividends and ability to meet its debt obligations largely depend on the performance of its subsidiaries and the ability to utilize the cash flows from those subsidiaries.

Sempra Energy’s ability to pay dividends and meet its debt obligations depends almost entirely on cash flows from its subsidiaries and, in the short term, its ability to raise capital from external sources. In the long term, cash flows from the subsidiaries depend on their ability to generate operating cash flows in excess of their own expenditures, common and preferred stock dividends (if any), and long-term debt obligations. In addition, the subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that are not obligated to pay dividends and could be precluded from making such distributions under certain circumstances, including, without limitation, as a result of legislation, regulation, court order, contractual restrictions or in times of financial distress.

A significant portion of our worldwide cash reserves are generated by, and therefore held in, foreign jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions impose taxes on cash transferred to the United States, which could reduce the cash available to us. To the extent we have excess cash in foreign locations that could be used in, or is needed by, our United States operations, we may incur significant U.S. and foreign taxes to repatriate these funds.

Conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally may materially adversely affect us.

Our businesses are capital intensive and we rely significantly on long-term debt to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and repay outstanding debt, and on short-term borrowings to fund a portion of day-to-day business operations.

Limitations on the availability of credit and increases in interest rates or credit spreads may materially adversely affect our businesses, cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects, as well as our ability to meet contractual and other commitments. In difficult credit market environments, we may find it necessary to fund our operations and capital expenditures at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support new business activities. This could cause us to reduce capital expenditures and could increase our cost of servicing debt, both of which could significantly reduce our short-term and long-term profitability.

The availability and cost of credit for our businesses may be greatly affected by credit ratings. If SoCalGas or SDG&E were to have their credit ratings downgraded, their cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected, and any downgrades of Sempra Energy’s credit ratings could materially adversely affect the cash flows and results of operations of Sempra Energy. If the credit ratings of Sempra Energy or any of its subsidiaries were downgraded, especially below investment grade, financing costs and the principal amount of borrowings would likely increase due to the additional risk of our debt and because certain counterparties may require collateral in the form of cash, a letter of credit or other forms of security for new and existing transactions. Such amounts may be material and could adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.

Sempra Energy has substantial investments in Mexico and South America which expose us to foreign currency, inflation, legal, tax, economic, geo-political and management oversight risk.

Mexico has developed a new legal framework for the regulation of the hydrocarbons and electric power sectors based on a package of constitutional amendments approved by the Mexican Congress in December 2013 and implementing legislation enacted in 2014 and the issuance of new regulations thereunder. However, given the relatively recent creation of this legal framework, it is uncertain how it will be interpreted in practice. We also cannot predict the manner in which the new legal framework will affect any new business opportunities that IEnova may wish to pursue. The changes introduced by the new legal framework may require IEnova to obtain amendments to its existing permits or secure additional permits to operate its energy facilities or to provide its services, to take additional actions to secure rights-of-way for its projects, to perform social impact assessments, and to obtain the consent of indigenous communities for the development of certain projects, any or all of which may cause IEnova to incur additional material costs in connection with the development of its projects.

The current U.S. administration has previously indicated its intention to renegotiate trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, and implement U.S. immigration policy changes. The current U.S. administration has stated that it is reviewing various options, including tariffs, for funding new Mexico–U.S. border security infrastructure. Such actions could result in changes in the Mexican, U.S. and other markets. In addition, if this occurs, the Mexican government could implement retaliatory actions, such as the imposition of restrictions or import fees on Mexican imports of natural gas from the U.S. or imports and exports of electricity to and from the U.S. Any of these actions by either or both governments could adversely affect imports and exports between Mexico and the U.S. and negatively impact the Mexican economy and the companies with whom we conduct business in Mexico, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or prospects.

Risks Related to All Sempra Energy Subsidiaries

Severe weather conditions, natural disasters, accidents, equipment failures, explosions or acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.

Like other major industrial facilities, ours may be damaged by severe weather conditions, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis and fires, accidents, equipment failures, explosions or acts of terrorism. Because we are in the business of using, storing, transporting and disposing of highly flammable and explosive materials, as well as radioactive materials, and operating highly energized equipment, the risks such incidents may pose to our facilities and infrastructure, as well as the risks to the surrounding communities, are substantially greater than the risks such incidents may pose to a typical business. The facilities and infrastructure that we own and in which we have interests that may be subject to such incidents include, but are not limited to:

▪natural gas, propane and ethane pipelines, storage and compression facilities▪LNG terminals and storage▪electric transmission and distribution▪nuclear fuel and nuclear waste storage facilities▪power generation plants, including natural gas-fired and renewable energy generation▪nuclear power facilities (currently being decommissioned)

Such incidents could result in severe business disruptions, prolonged power outages, property damage, injuries or loss of life, significant decreases in revenues and earnings, and/or significant additional costs to us. Any such incident could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.

Depending on the nature and location of the facilities and infrastructure affected, any such incident also could cause catastrophic fires; natural gas, natural gas odorant, propane or ethane leaks; releases of other greenhouse gases; radioactive releases; explosions, spills or other significant damage to natural resources or property belonging to third parties; personal injuries, health impacts or fatalities; or present a nuisance to impacted communities. Any of these consequences could lead to significant claims against us. In some cases, we may be liable for damages even though we are not at fault, such as in cases where the concept of inverse condemnation applies. Insurance coverage may significantly increase in cost, may be disputed by the insurers, or may become unavailable for certain of these risks, and any insurance proceeds we receive may be insufficient to cover our losses or liabilities due to the existence of limitations, exclusions, high deductibles, failure to comply with procedural requirements, and other factors, which could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.

Severe weather conditions may also impact our businesses, including our international operations. Drought conditions in California and the western United States increase the risk of catastrophic wildfires in SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ service territories, which could place third party property and our electric and natural gas infrastructure in jeopardy. Drought conditions also reduce the amount of power available from hydro-electric generation facilities in the Northwest United States, which could adversely impact the availability of a reliable energy supply into the California electric grid managed by the California ISO. If alternate supplies of electric generation are not available to replace the lower level of power available from hydro-electric generation facilities, this could result in temporary power shortages in SDG&E’s service territory. In addition, severe weather conditions could result in delays and/or cost increases to our capital projects.

Another example of weather impacting operations is a strong El Niño weather pattern in the Pacific Ocean, which can cause severe rainstorms in coastal areas. Significant rainstorms and associated high winds, such as those caused by a strong El Niño weather pattern, could damage our electric and natural gas infrastructure, resulting in increased expenses, including higher maintenance and repair costs, and interruptions in electricity and natural gas delivery services. As a result, these events can have significant financial consequences, including regulatory penalties and disallowances if the California Utilities or our utilities in Mexico or South America encounter difficulties in restoring service to their customers on a timely basis. Further, the cost of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our businesses are subject to complex government regulations and tax requirements and may be materially adversely affected by changes in these regulations or requirements or in their interpretation or implementation.

In recent years, the regulatory environment that applies to the electric power and natural gas industries has undergone significant changes, on the federal, state and local levels. These changes have affected the nature of these industries and the manner in which their participants conduct their businesses. These changes are ongoing, and we cannot predict the future course of changes in this regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment will have on our businesses. Moreover, existing regulations, laws and tariffs may be revised or reinterpreted, and new regulations, laws and tariffs may be adopted or become applicable to us and our facilities. Special tariffs may also be imposed on components used in our businesses that could increase costs.

Our businesses are subject to increasingly complex accounting and tax requirements, and the regulations, laws and tariffs that affect us may change in response to economic or political conditions. Compliance with these requirements could increase our operating costs, and new tax legislation, regulations or other interpretations in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate could materially adversely affect our tax expense and/or tax balances. Changes in tax policies, including potential tax reform provisions, such as the elimination of the deduction for interest and non-deductibility of all or a portion of the cost of imported materials, equipment and commodities, could materially adversely impact our business. Changes in regulations, laws and tariffs and how they are implemented and interpreted may have a material adverse effect on our businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects. We discuss potential U.S. federal tax reform further in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Factors Influencing Performance” in the Annual Report.

Our operations are subject to rules relating to transactions among the California Utilities and other Sempra Energy businesses. These rules are commonly referred to as “affiliate rules,” which primarily impact commodity and commodity-related transactions. These businesses could be materially adversely affected by changes in these rules or to their interpretations, or by additional CPUC or FERC rules that further restrict our ability to sell electricity or natural gas to, or to trade with, the California Utilities and with each other. Affiliate rules also could require us to obtain prior approval from the CPUC before entering into any such transactions with the California Utilities. Any such restrictions on or approval requirements for transactions among affiliates could materially adversely affect the LNG terminals, natural gas pipelines, electric generation facilities, or other operations of our subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or prospects.

Our businesses require numerous permits, licenses, franchise agreements, and other governmental approvals from various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies; any failure to obtain or maintain required permits, licenses or approvals could cause our sales to materially decline and/or our costs to materially increase, and otherwise materially adversely affect our businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.

Our businesses have significant environmental compliance costs, and future environmental compliance costs could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.

In addition, existing and future laws, orders and regulations regarding mercury, nitrogen and sulfur oxides, particulates, methane or other emissions could result in requirements for additional monitoring, pollution monitoring and control equipment, safety practices or emission fees, taxes or penalties that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and/or cash flows. Moreover, existing rules and regulations may be interpreted or revised in ways that may materially adversely affect our results of operations and/or cash flows.

We provide further discussion of these matters in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

Our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows may be materially adversely affected by the outcome of litigation against us.

Sempra Energy and its subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and arbitration proceedings. We have spent, and continue to spend, substantial amounts of money and time defending these lawsuits and proceedings, and in related investigations and regulatory proceedings. We discuss pending proceedings in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Annual Report. The uncertainties inherent in lawsuits, arbitrations and other legal proceedings make it difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty the costs and effects of resolving these matters. In addition, juries have demonstrated a willingness to grant large awards, including punitive damages, in personal injury, product liability, property damage and other claims. Accordingly, actual costs incurred may differ materially from insured or reserved amounts and may not be recoverable in whole or in part in rates from our customers, which in each case could materially adversely affect our businesses, cash flows, results of operations and/or financial condition.

We cannot and do not attempt to fully hedge our assets or contract positions against changes in commodity prices. In addition, for those contract positions that are hedged, our hedging procedures may not mitigate our risk as planned.

To reduce financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, we may enter into contracts to hedge our known or anticipated purchase and sale commitments, inventories of natural gas and LNG, natural gas storage and pipeline capacity and electric generation capacity. As part of this strategy, we may use forward contracts, physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and options. We do not hedge the entire exposure to market price volatility of our assets or our contract positions, and the coverage will vary over time. To the extent we have unhedged positions, or if our hedging strategies do not work as planned, fluctuating commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition. Certain of the contracts we use for hedging purposes are subject to fair value accounting. Such accounting may result in gains or losses in earnings for those contracts. In certain cases, these gains or losses may not reflect the associated losses or gains of the underlying position being hedged.

In addition, possible changes in federal regulation of over-the-counter derivatives regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission could impact the cost and effectiveness of our hedging programs, as we discuss in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations –Factors Influencing Future Performance” in the Annual Report.

Risk management procedures may not prevent losses.

Although we have in place risk management and control systems that use advanced methodologies to quantify and manage risk, these systems may not always prevent material losses. Risk management procedures may not always be followed as required by our businesses or may not always work as planned. In addition, daily value-at-risk and loss limits are based on historic price movements. If prices significantly or persistently deviate from historic prices, the limits may not protect us from significant losses. As a result of these and other factors, there is no assurance that our risk management procedures will prevent losses that would materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition.

The operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees.

Several of our businesses have entered into and have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions. Our collective bargaining agreements are generally negotiated on a company-by-company basis. Any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes, boycotts or other labor disruptions. Labor disruptions, strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases, whether due to union activities, employee turnover or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows.

New business technologies implemented by us or developed by others present a risk for increased attacks on our information systems and the integrity of our energy grid and our natural gas pipeline and storage infrastructure.

In the ordinary course of business, Sempra Energy and its subsidiaries collect and retain sensitive information, including personal identification information about customers and employees, customer energy usage and other information. The theft, damage or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data can subject us to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, subject us to claims from third parties, require compliance with notification and monitoring regulations, and harm our reputation.

Finally, as seen with recent cyber-attacks around the world, the goal of a cyber-attack may be primarily to inflict large-scale harm on a company and the places where it operates. Any such cyber-attack could cause widespread disruptions to our operating and administrative systems, including the destruction of critical information and programming, that could materially adversely affect our business operations and the integrity of the power grid, and/or release confidential information about our company and our customers, employees and other constituents.

Our businesses will need to continue to adapt to technological change which may cause us to incur significant expenditures to adapt to these changes and which efforts may not be successful.

Emerging technologies may be superior to, or may not be compatible with, some of our existing technologies, investments and infrastructure, and may require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitive, or may result in the obsolescence of certain of our operating assets or the operating assets of our equity method investments. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability and our investment partners’ abilities to anticipate and successfully adapt to technological changes, to offer services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards and to recover all, or a significant portion of, any unrecovered investment in obsolete assets. If we incur significant expenditures in adapting to technological changes, fail to adapt to significant technological changes, fail to obtain access to important new technologies, fail to recover a significant portion of any remaining investment in obsolete assets, or if implemented technology fails to operate as intended, our businesses, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Examples of technological changes that could negatively impact our businesses include

▪Sempra Utilities – Technologies that could change the utilization of natural gas distribution and electric generation, transmission and distribution assets including

◦energy storage technology, and

◦the expanded cost-effective utilization of distributed generation (e.g., rooftop solar and community solar projects).

▪Sempra Infrastructure

◦At Sempra Renewables, technological advances in distributed and local power generation and energy storage could reduce the demand for large-scale renewable electricity generation. Sempra Renewables’ power sales customers’ ability to perform under long-term agreements could be impacted by changes in utility rate structures and advances in distributed and local power generation.

◦At Sempra LNG & Midstream, technological advances could reduce the demand for natural gas. These technologies include cost-effective batteries for renewable electricity generation, economic improvements to gas-to-liquids conversion processes, and advances in alternative fuels and other alternative energy sources.

Risks Related to the California Utilities

The California Utilities are subject to extensive regulation by state, federal and local legislative and regulatory authorities, which may materially adversely affect us.

The CPUC regulates the California Utilities’ rates, except SDG&E’s electric transmission rates which are regulated by the FERC. The CPUC also regulates the California Utilities’:

▪conditions of service▪rates of depreciation▪capital structure▪long-term resource procurement▪rates of return▪sales of securities

The CPUC conducts various reviews and audits of utility performance, safety standards and practices, compliance with CPUC regulations and standards, affiliate relationships and other matters. These reviews and audits may result in disallowances, fines and penalties that could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. SoCalGas and SDG&E may be subject to penalties or fines related to their operation of natural gas pipelines and storage and, for SDG&E, electric operations, under regulations concerning natural gas pipeline safety and citation programs concerning both gas and electric safety, which could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. We discuss various CPUC proceedings relating to the California Utilities’ rates, costs, incentive mechanisms, and performance-based regulation in Notes 13, 14 and 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Annual Report.

The CPUC periodically approves the California Utilities’ rates based on authorized capital expenditures, operating costs, including income taxes, and an authorized rate of return on investment. Delays by the CPUC on decisions authorizing recovery or authorizations for less than full recovery may adversely affect the working capital and financial condition of each of the California Utilities. If the California Utilities receive an adverse CPUC decision and/or actual capital expenditures and/or operating costs were to exceed the amounts approved by the CPUC, our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected. Reductions in key benchmark interest rates may trigger automatic adjustment mechanisms which would reduce the California Utilities’ authorized rates of return, changes in which could materially adversely affect their results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.

In December 2014, the CPUC issued a decision incorporating a risk-based decision-making framework into all future general rate case (GRC) application filings for major natural gas and electric utilities in California. As the framework is still in the developing stages, we cannot estimate whether its application in future GRC applications will result in full recovery of costs. We discuss this further in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Factors Influencing Future Performance” in the Annual Report.

The CPUC applies performance-based measures and mechanisms to all California utilities. Under these, earnings potential over authorized base margins is tied to achieving or exceeding specific performance and operating goals, and reductions in authorized base margins are tied to not achieving specific performance and operating goals. At both of the California Utilities, the areas that are currently eligible for performance mechanisms are operational activities designated by the CPUC and energy efficiency programs; at SDG&E, electric reliability performance; and, at SoCalGas, natural gas procurement and unbundled natural gas storage and system operator hub services. Although the California Utilities have received incentive awards in the past, there can be no assurance that they will receive awards in the future, or that any future awards earned would be in amounts comparable to prior periods. Additionally, if the California Utilities fail to achieve certain minimum performance levels established under such mechanisms, they may be assessed financial disallowances, penalties and fines which could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.

In September 2016, California adopted new laws concerning the CPUC that establish rules governing, among other subjects, communications between CPUC officials, CPUC staff and regulated utilities. Changes to the rules and processes aroundex partecommunications could result in delayed decisions, increased investigations, enforcement actions and penalties. In addition, the CPUC or other parties may initiate investigations of past communications between public utilities and CPUC officials and staff that could result in reopening completed proceedings for reconsideration.

The FERC regulates electric transmission rates, the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce, transmission access, the rates of return on investments in electric transmission assets, and other similar matters involving SDG&E.

The California Utilities may be materially adversely affected by new legislation, regulations, decisions, orders or interpretations of the CPUC, the FERC or other regulatory bodies. In addition, existing legislation or regulations may be revised or reinterpreted. New, revised or reinterpreted legislation, regulations, decisions, orders or interpretations could change how the California Utilities operate, could affect their ability to recover various costs through rates or adjustment mechanisms, or could require them to incur substantial additional expenses.

Our California Utilities are also affected by the activities of organizations such as The Utility Reform Network (TURN), Utility Consumers’ Action Network, Sierra Club and other stakeholder, advocacy and activist groups. Operations that may be influenced by these groups include

▪the rates charged to our customers;

▪our ability to site and construct new facilities;

▪our ability to purchase or construct generating facilities;

▪safety;

▪the issuance of securities;

▪accounting and income tax matters;

▪transactions between affiliates;

▪the installation of environmental emission controls equipment;

▪our ability to decommission generating and other facilities and recover the remaining carrying value of such facilities and related costs;

▪our ability to recover costs incurred in connection with nuclear decommissioning activities from trust funds established to pay for such costs;

▪the amount of certain sources of energy we must use, such as renewable sources; limits on the amount of certain energy sources we can use, such as natural gas; and programs to encourage reductions in energy usage by customers; and

▪the amount of costs associated with these and other operations that may be recovered from customers.

SoCalGas will incur significant costs and expenses related to remediating the natural gas leak at its Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility and to mitigate local community and environmental impacts from the leak, some or a substantial portion of which may not be recoverable through insurance, and SoCalGas also may incur significant liabilities for fines, penalties, damages and greenhouse gas mitigation activities as a result of this incident, some or a significant portion of which may not be recoverable through insurance.

In October 2015, SoCalGas discovered a leak at one of its injection-and-withdrawal wells, SS25, at its Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility, located in the northern part of the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles County. The Aliso Canyon facility has been operated by SoCalGas since 1972. SS25 is more than one mile away from and 1,200 feet above the closest homes. It is one of more than 100 injection-and-withdrawal wells at the storage facility. SoCalGas worked closely with several of the world’s leading experts to stop the leak, and in February 2016, DOGGR confirmed that the well was permanently sealed.

Local Community Mitigation Efforts

Pursuant to a stipulation and order by the Los Angeles County Superior Court (Superior Court), SoCalGas provided temporary relocation support to residents in the nearby community who requested it before the well was permanently sealed, at significant expense to SoCalGas. Following the permanent sealing of the well and the completion of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health’s (DPH) indoor testing of certain homes in the Porter Ranch community, which concluded that indoor conditions did not present a long-term health risk and that it was safe for residents to return home, the Superior Court issued an order in May 2016 ruling that currently relocated residents be given the choice to request residence cleaning prior to returning home, with such cleaning to be performed according to the DPH’s proposed protocol and at SoCalGas’ expense. SoCalGas completed the cleaning program, and the relocation program ended in July 2016.

Apart from the Superior Court order, in May 2016 the DPH also issued a directive that SoCalGas professionally clean (in accordance with the proposed protocol prepared by the DPH) the homes of all residents located within the Porter Ranch Neighborhood Council boundary, or who participated in the relocation program, or who are located within a five mile radius of the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility and have experienced symptoms from the natural gas leak (the Directive). SoCalGas disputes the Directive, contending that it is invalid and unenforceable, and has filed a petition for writ of mandate to set aside the Directive.

The total costs incurred to mitigate local community impacts of the leak are significant and may increase, and to the extent not covered by insurance (including any costs in excess of applicable policy limits), or if there were to be significant delays in receiving insurance recoveries, such costs could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas’ and Sempra Energy’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.

Governmental Investigations and Civil and Criminal Litigation

Various governmental agencies, including DOGGR, DPH, SCAQMD, CARB, Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board, California Division of Occupational Safety and Health, CPUC, PHMSA, EPA, Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office and California Attorney General’s Office, have investigated or are investigating this incident. Other federal agencies (e.g., the DOE and U.S. Department of the Interior) investigated the incident in conjunction with the preparation of an Interagency Task Force report,Ensuring Safe and Reliable Underground Natural Gas Storage, published in October 2016. In January 2016, DOGGR and the CPUC selected Blade Energy Partners to conduct an independent analysis under their supervision and to be funded by SoCalGas to investigate the technical root cause of the Aliso Canyon gas leak. This investigation is currently ongoing.

As of February 27, 2017,250lawsuits, including over14,000plaintiffs, have been filed against SoCalGas, some of which have also named Sempra Energy. These various lawsuits assert causes of action for negligence, negligence per se, strict liability, property damage, fraud, public and private nuisance (continuing and permanent), trespass, inverse condemnation, fraudulent concealment, unfair business practices and loss of consortium, among other things. A complaint alleging violations of Proposition 65 was also filed. Many of these complaints seek class action status, compensatory and punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief, costs of future medical monitoring and attorneys’ fees.

Additional litigation may be filed against us in the future related to the Aliso Canyon incident or our responses thereto. For a more detailed description of the governmental investigations and civil and criminal lawsuits brought against us, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

The costs of defending against the civil and criminal lawsuits, cooperating with the various investigations, and any damages, restitution, and civil and criminal fines, costs and other penalties, if awarded or imposed, could be significant and to the extent not covered by insurance (including any costs in excess of applicable policy limits), or if there were to be significant delays in receiving insurance recoveries, such costs could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas’ and Sempra Energy’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.

Governmental Orders and Additional Regulation

In January 2016, the Governor of the State of California issued an Order proclaiming a state of emergency to exist in Los Angeles County due to the natural gas leak at the Aliso Canyon facility. The Governor’s Order imposed various orders with respect to: stopping the leak; protecting public health and safety; ensuring accountability; and strengthening oversight. Also in January 2016, the Hearing Board of the SCAQMD ordered SoCalGas to take various actions in connection with injections and withdrawals of natural gas at Aliso Canyon, sealing the well, monitoring, reporting, safety and funding a health study, among other things. As discussed above, SoCalGas has entered into a settlement agreement with the SCAQMD that calls for the SCAQMD to petition its Hearing Board for dismissal of the order. We provide further detail regarding the Governor’s Order and SCAQMD’s order in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

In December 2015, SoCalGas made a commitment to mitigate the actual natural gas released from the leak and has been working on a plan to accomplish the mitigation. In March 2016, pursuant to the Governor’s Order, the CARB issued its recommended approach to achieve full mitigation of the climate impacts from the Aliso Canyon natural gas leak, which includes recommendations that:

▪reductions in short-lived climate pollutants and other greenhouse gases be at least equivalent to the amount of the emissions from the leak,

▪a 20-year global warming potential be used in deriving the amount of reductions required (rather than the 100-year term the CARB and other state and federal agencies use in regulating emissions), and

▪all of the mitigation occur in California over the next five to ten years without the use of allowances or offsets.

In October 2016, CARB issued a final report concluding that the incident resulted in total emissions from 90,350 to 108,950 metric tons of methane, and asserting that SoCalGas should mitigate 109,000 metric tons of methane to fully mitigate the greenhouse gas impacts of the leak. Although we have not agreed with CARB’s estimate of methane released, we continue to work with CARB on developing a mitigation plan. The costs of mitigating the actual natural gas released could be significant and to the extent not covered by insurance (including any costs in excess of applicable policy limits), or if there were to be significant delays in receiving insurance recoveries, such costs could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas’ and Sempra Energy’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.

In June 2016, the “Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016” or the “PIPES Act of 2016” was enacted. Among other things, the PIPES Act requires PHMSA to issue, within two years of passage, “minimum safety standards for underground natural gas storage facilities,” and imposes a “user fee” on underground storage facilities as needed to implement the safety standards. In October 2016, the Interagency Task Force formed by the DOE and PHMSA in response to the leak at Aliso Canyon issued its report, recommending that PHMSA adopt new safety regulations and providing 44 specific recommendations to industry and to federal, state, and local regulators and governments, which may result in additional regulations.

PHMSA, DOGGR, SCAQMD, EPA and CARB have each commenced separate rulemaking proceedings to adopt further regulations covering natural gas storage facilities and injection wells. DOGGR has issued new draft regulations for all storage fields in California, and in 2016, the California Legislature enacted four separate bills providing for additional regulation of natural gas storage facilities. Also, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors formed a task force to review and potentially implement new, more stringent land use (zoning) requirements and associated regulations and enforcement protocols for oil and gas activities, including natural gas storage field operations. We provide further detail regarding new regulations and legislation in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Factors Influencing Future Performance” and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

Additional hearings in the California Legislature, as well as with various other federal and state regulatory agencies, have been or may be scheduled, additional legislation has been proposed in the California Legislature, and additional laws, orders, rules and regulations may be adopted. Higher operating costs and additional capital expenditures incurred by SoCalGas as a result of new laws, orders, rules and regulations arising out of the Aliso Canyon incident or our responses thereto could be significant and may not be recoverable through insurance or in customer rates, and SoCalGas’ and Sempra Energy’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by any such new laws, orders, rules and regulations.

Natural Gas Storage Operations and Reliability

Natural gas withdrawn from storage is important for service reliability during peak demand periods, including peak electric generation needs in the summer and heating needs in the winter. Aliso Canyon, with a storage capacity of 86 Bcf (which represents 63 percent of SoCalGas’ natural gas storage inventory capacity), is the largest SoCalGas storage facility and an important element of SoCalGas’ delivery system. SoCalGas has not injected natural gas into Aliso Canyon since October 25, 2015, pursuant to orders by DOGGR and the Governor, and SB 380. Limited withdrawals of natural gas from Aliso Canyon have been made in 2017 to augment natural gas supplies during critical demand periods. In November 2016, SoCalGas submitted a request to DOGGR seeking authorization to resume injection operations at the Aliso Canyon storage facility. In accordance with SB 380, DOGGR held public meetings on February 1 and 2, 2017 to receive public comment on DOGGR’s findings from its gas storage and well safety review and proposed pressure limits for the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility. The public comment period has expired. It remains for DOGGR to issue its safety determination, after which the CPUC must concur with DOGGR’s determination, before injections at the facility can resume.

If the Aliso Canyon facility were to be taken out of service for any meaningful period of time, it could result in an impairment of the facility, significantly higher than expected operating costs and/or additional capital expenditures, and natural gas reliability and electric generation could be jeopardized. At December 31, 2016, the Aliso Canyon facility has a net book value of $531 million, including $217 million of construction work in progress for the project to construct a new compression station. Any significant impairment of this asset could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas’ and Sempra Energy’s results of operations for the period in which it is recorded. Higher operating costs and additional capital expenditures incurred by SoCalGas may not be recoverable in customer rates, and SoCalGas’ and Sempra Energy’s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.

Insurance and Estimated Costs

Additional Information

We discuss Aliso Canyon matters further in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations– Factors Influencing Future Performance” in the Annual Report.

Natural gas pipeline safety assessments may not be fully or adequately recovered in rates.

Pending the outcome of various regulatory agency evaluations of natural gas pipeline safety regulations, practices and procedures, Sempra Energy, including the California Utilities, may incur incremental expense and capital investment associated with their natural gas pipeline operations and investments. The California Utilities filed implementation plans with the CPUC to test or replace natural gas transmission pipelines located in populated areas that either have not been pressure tested or lack sufficient documentation of a pressure test, to enhance existing valve infrastructure and to retrofit pipelines to allow for the use of in-line inspection technology, referred to as SoCalGas’ and SDG&E’s Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan (PSEP).

In June 2014, the CPUC issued a final decision approving the utilities’ plan for implementing PSEP, and established criteria to determine the amounts related to PSEP that may be recovered from ratepayers and the processes for recovery of such amounts, including providing that such costs are subject to a reasonableness review. In the future, certain PSEP costs may be subject to recovery as determined by separate regulatory filings with the CPUC, including GRC filings.

Various PSEP-related proceedings are regularly pending before the CPUC regarding the California Utilities’ reasonableness review and cost recovery requests, which are often challenged by intervening parties. These proceedings are described in more detail in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations– Factors Influencing Future Performance” in the Annual Report. In the future, consumer advocacy groups may similarly challenge the California Utilities’ petitions for recovery and recommend disallowances in whole or in part with respect to applications to recover PSEP costs.

From 2011 through 2016, SoCalGas and SDG&E have invested $1.1 billion and $302 million, respectively, in PSEP. As of December 31, 2016, SoCalGas has received approval for recovery of $33 million. If the CPUC were to deny rate recovery for PSEP and other gas pipeline safety costs incurred by SoCalGas and SDG&E, it could materially adversely affect the respective company’s cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

The California Utilities are subject to increasingly stringent safety standards and the potential for significant penalties if regulators deem either SDG&E or SoCalGas to be out of compliance.

California Senate Bill (SB) 291 requires the CPUC to develop and maintain a safety enforcement program that includes procedures for monitoring, data tracking and analysis, and investigations, and delegates citation authority to CPUC staff personnel under the direction of the CPUC Executive Director. In exercising this citation authority, the CPUC staff is to take into account voluntary reporting of potential violations, voluntary resolution efforts undertaken, prior history of violations, the gravity of the violation, and the degree of culpability. The CPUC previously implemented both electric and gas safety enforcement programs whereby electric and gas utilities may be cited by CPUC staff for violations of the CPUC’s safety requirements or applicable federal standards.

Under each enforcement program, each day of an ongoing violation may be counted as an additional offense. The maximum penalty is $50,000 per offense. Citations under either program may be appealed to the CPUC. Penalties imposed under these programs can be significant, exceeding $1.5 billion in one instance. In September 2016, the CPUC issued a decision making further refinements to the electric and gas safety enforcement programs. The decision harmonizes the rules for the two programs, further defines the criteria for issuing a citation and penalty, sets an administrative limit of $8 million per citation issued by staff under its delegated authority and makes certain other changes to rules related to self-reporting and notifying local officials.

If the CPUC or its staff determine that either of SDG&E’s or SoCalGas’ operations and practices are not in compliance with applicable safety standards and operating procedures, the corrective or mitigation actions required to be in conformance, if not sufficiently funded in customer rates, and any penalties imposed could materially adversely affect that company’s cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

The failure by the CPUC to continue reforms of SDG&E’s rate structure, including the implementation of a more significant fixed charge, could have a material adverse effect on its business, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.

If the CPUC fails to continue to reform SDG&E’s rate structure by implementing a rate structure that maintains reasonable, cost-based electric rates that are competitive with alternative sources of power and adequate to maintain the reliability of the electric transmission and distribution system, such failure could have a material adverse effect on SDG&E’s business, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.

Meaningful net energy metering, or NEM, reform must continue to progress to ensure that SDG&E is authorized to recover its costs in providing services to NEM customers while minimizing the cost shift (or subsidy) being borne by non-solar customers.

Due to current rate structures and state policies, customers who self-generate their own power using eligible renewable resources (primarily solar installations) currently do not pay their proportionate cost of maintaining and operating the electric transmission and distribution system, subject to certain limitations, while they still receive power from the system when their self-generation is inadequate to meet their electricity needs. The proportionate costs not paid by NEM customers are paid (i.e., subsidized) by consumers not participating in NEM. In addition, the continuing increase of self-generated solar, other forms of self-generation and other local off-the-grid sources of power adversely impacts the reliability of the electric transmission and distribution system.

Appropriate NEM reforms are necessary to ensure that SDG&E is authorized to recover, from NEM customers, the costs incurred in providing grid and energy services, as well as mandated legislative and regulatory public policy programs. SDG&E believes this design would be preferable to recovering these costs from customers not participating in NEM. If NEM self-generating installations were to increase substantially between 2016 and when more significant reforms take effect in 2019 or later, as described below, the rate structure adopted by the CPUC could have a material adverse effect on SDG&E’s business, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.

In July 2014, the CPUC initiated a rulemaking proceeding to develop a successor tariff to the state’s existing NEM program pursuant to the provisions of AB 327. The NEM program was originally established in 1995 and is an electric billing tariff mechanism designed to promote the installation of on-site renewable generation. Under NEM, qualifying customer-generators receive a full retail rate for the energy they generate that is fed back to the utility’s power grid. This occurs during times when the customer’s generation exceeds their own energy usage. In addition, if a NEM customer generates any electricity over the annual measurement period that exceeds its annual consumption, they receive compensation at a rate equal to a wholesale energy price.

In January 2016, the CPUC adopted a decision making modest changes to the NEM program, which require NEM customers to pay some costs that would otherwise be borne by non-NEM customers and moves new NEM customers to time-of-use rates. Together with a reduction in tiered rate differentials and the potential implementation of a fixed charge component in 2020, these changes to the NEM program begin a process of reducing the cost burden on non-NEM customers, but SDG&E believes that further reforms are necessary and appropriate. In March 2016, SDG&E, Edison, PG&E, TURN and the California Coalition of Utility Employees filed applications with the CPUC requesting rehearing of its January 2016 decision. In September 2016, the CPUC issued an order denying the rehearing requests in all respects. SDG&E implemented the adopted successor NEM tariff in July 2016, after reaching the 617-MW cap established for the prior NEM program.

The electricity industry is undergoing significant change, including increased deployment of distributed energy resources, technological advancements, and political and regulatory developments.

Electric utilities in California are experiencing increasing deployment of distributed energy resources, such as solar, energy storage, energy efficiency and demand response technologies. This growth will eventually require modernization of the electric distribution grid to, among other things, accommodate two-way flows of electricity and increase the grid’s capacity to interconnect distributed energy resources. The CPUC is conducting proceedings:  to evaluate changes to the planning and operation of the electric distribution grid in order to prepare for higher penetration of distributed energy resources; to consider future grid modernization and grid reinforcement investments; to evaluate if traditional grid investments can be deferred by distributed energy resources, and if feasible, what, if any, compensation would be appropriate; and to clarify the role of the electric distribution grid operator. These proceedings may result in new regulations, policies and/or operational changes that could materially adversely affect SDG&E’s business, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.

SDG&E provides bundled electric procurement service through various resources that are typically procured on a long-term basis. While SDG&E provides such procurement service for the majority of its customer load, customers do have the ability to receive procurement service from a load serving entity other than SDG&E, through programs such as Direct Access and Community Choice Aggregation (CCA). Direct Access is currently closed, but utility customers have the ability to receive procurement through CCA, if the customer’s local jurisdiction (city) offers such a program. A number of cities in our service territory have expressed interest in CCA, which, if widely adopted, could result in substantial reductions in the load we are required to serve. When customers are served by another load serving entity, SDG&E no longer serves this departing load and the associated costs of the utility’s procured resources are borne by its remaining bundled procurement customers. This issue is addressed by rate mechanisms that attempt to ensure bundled ratepayer indifference in the event of departing load, but these existing mechanisms may not be sufficient to address the full extent of the potential cost shift in the event of significant departing load, and SDG&E bears some risk that its procured resources become stranded and the associated costs are not recoverable.

In addition, the FERC has adopted changes that have opened transmission development to competition from independent developers, allowing such developers to compete with incumbent utilities for the construction and operation of transmission facilities. These changes could materially adversely affect SDG&E’s business and prospects.

Recovery of 2007 wildfire litigation costs requires future regulatory approval, and insurance coverage for future wildfires may not be sufficient to cover losses we may incur.

SDG&E is seeking to recover in rates its reasonably incurred costs of resolving 2007 wildfire claims in excess of its liability insurance coverage and amounts recovered from third parties. ThroughDecember 31, 2016, SDG&E’s payments for claim settlements plus funds estimated to be required for settlement of outstanding claims and legal fees have exceeded its liability insurance coverage and amounts recovered from third parties. However, SDG&E has concluded that it is probable that it will be permitted to recover in rates a substantial portion of the reasonably incurred costs of resolving wildfire claims in excess of its liability insurance coverage and amounts recovered from third parties. AtDecember 31, 2016, Sempra Energy’s and SDG&E’s Consolidated Balance Sheets included$352 millionin Other Regulatory Assets (long-term) related to CPUC-regulated operations for these costs incurred and the estimated resolution of pending claims.

In December 2012, the CPUC issued a final decision allowing SDG&E to maintain an authorized memorandum account, enabling SDG&E to file applications with the CPUC requesting recovery of amounts properly recorded in the memorandum account, subject to reasonableness review, at a later date. In September 2015, SDG&E filed an application with the CPUC requesting rate recovery of such costs, and is proposing to recover the costs in rates over a six- to ten-year period. The CPUC has scheduled a two-phased proceeding to address SDG&E’s request. SDG&E has responded to testimony submitted by intervening parties raising various concerns with SDG&E’s operations and management prior to and during the 2007 wildfires, and have asked the CPUC to reject SDG&E’s request for cost recovery. We discuss these cost recovery proceedings in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations –Factors Influencing Future Performance” and in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

Recovery of these costs in rates will require future regulatory approval. SDG&E will continue to assess the likelihood, amount and timing of such recoveries in rates. Should SDG&E conclude that recovery of excess wildfire costs in rates is no longer probable, at that time SDG&E would record a charge against earnings. If SDG&E had concluded that the recovery of regulatory assets related to CPUC-regulated operations was no longer probable or was less than currently estimated at December 31, 2016, the resulting after-tax charge against earnings would have been up to approximately $208 million. A failure to obtain substantial or full recovery of these costs from customers, or any negative assessment of the likelihood of recovery, would likely have a material adverse effect on Sempra Energy’s and SDG&E’s financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. We discuss how we assess the probability of recovery of our regulatory assets in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

We have experienced increased costs and difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires that could arise from the California Utilities’ operations. In addition, the insurance that has been obtained for wildfire liabilities may not be sufficient to cover all losses that we may incur. Uninsured losses and increases in the cost of insurance may not be recoverable in customer rates. A loss which is not fully insured or cannot be recovered in customer rates could materially adversely affect Sempra Energy’s and the affected California Utility’s financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Furthermore, insurance for wildfire liabilities may not continue to be available at all or at rates or with terms similar to those presently available.

SDG&E may incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of its partial ownership of a nuclear facility that is being decommissioned.

SDG&E has a 20-percent ownership interest in SONGS, a 2,150-MW nuclear generating facility near San Clemente, California, that is in the process of being decommissioned by Edison, the majority owner of SONGS. SONGS is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC and the CPUC. On June 6, 2013, Edison notified SDG&E that it had reached a decision to permanently retire SONGS and seek approval from the NRC to start the decommissioning activities for the entire facility. SDG&E, and each of the other owners, holds its undivided interest as a tenant in common in the property, and each owner is responsible for financing its share of expenses and capital expenditures, including decommissioning activities. Although the facility is being decommissioned, SDG&E’s ownership interest in SONGS continues to subject it to the risks of owning a partial interest in a nuclear generation facility, which include

▪the potential that a natural disaster such as an earthquake or tsunami could cause a catastrophic failure of the safety systems in place that are designed to prevent the release of radioactive material. If such a failure were to occur, a substantial amount of radiation could be released and cause catastrophic harm to human health and the environment;

▪the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the prior operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials;

▪limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with operations and the decommissioning of the facility; and

▪uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning the facility.

In addition, SDG&E maintains nuclear decommissioning trusts for the purpose of providing funds to decommission SONGS. Trust assets have been generally invested in equity and debt securities, which are subject to significant market fluctuations. A decline in the market value of trust assets or an adverse change in the law regarding funding requirements for decommissioning trusts could increase the funding requirements for these trusts, which in each case may not be fully recoverable in rates. Furthermore, CPUC approval is required in order to make withdrawals from these trusts. CPUC approval for certain expenditures may be denied by the CPUC altogether if the CPUC determines that the expenditures are unreasonable. Finally, decommissioning may be materially more expensive than we currently anticipate and therefore decommissioning costs may exceed the amounts in the trust funds. Rate recovery for overruns would require CPUC approval, which may not occur.

In November 2014, the CPUC approved the Amended Settlement Agreement that resolved the investigation into the steam generator replacement project that ultimately led to the shut-down of SONGS. Various petitions have since been filed to reopen the settlement. In December 2016, the Commissioner and Administrative Law Judge assigned to the proceeding issued a ruling directing SDG&E and Edison to “meet and confer” with other parties to the proceeding to determine whether an agreement could be reached to modify the Amended Settlement Agreement previously approved by the CPUC to resolve allegations that unreportedex partecommunications between Edison and the CPUC resulted in an unfair advantage at the time the settlement agreement was negotiated. If no agreement to modify the Amended Settlement Agreement is reached by April 28, 2017, the CPUC will consider other options, including entertaining additional testimony, hearings and briefs. We cannot assure you that the Amended Settlement Agreement will not be renegotiated, modified or set aside as a result of this proceeding. We provide additional detail in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

The occurrence of any of these events could result in a substantial reduction in our expected recovery and have a material adverse effect on SDG&E’s and Sempra Energy’s businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.

Risks Related to our Sempra South American Utilities and Sempra Infrastructure Businesses

Our businesses are exposed to market risks, including fluctuations in commodity prices, and our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects may be materially adversely affected by these risks. Energy-related commodity prices impact LNG liquefaction and regasification, the transport and storage of natural gas, and power generation from renewable and conventional sources, among other businesses that we operate and invest in.

We buy energy-related commodities from time to time, for LNG terminals or power plants to satisfy contractual obligations with customers, in regional markets and other competitive markets in which we compete. Our revenues and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if the prevailing market prices for natural gas, LNG, electricity or other commodities that we buy change in a direction or manner not anticipated and for which we had not provided adequately through purchase or sale commitments or other hedging transactions. In particular, North American natural gas prices, when in decline, negatively impact profitability atSempra LNG & Midstream.

Unanticipated changes in market prices for energy-related commodities result from multiple factors, including:

▪weather conditions

▪seasonality

▪changes in supply and demand

▪transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies

▪availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources

▪commodity production levels

▪actions by oil and natural gas producing nations or organizations affecting the global supply of crude oil and natural gas

▪federal, state and foreign energy and environmental regulation and legislation

▪natural disasters, wars, embargoes and other catastrophic events

▪expropriation of assets by foreign countries

The FERC has jurisdiction over wholesale power and transmission rates, independent system operators, and other entities that control transmission facilities or that administer wholesale power sales in some of the markets in which we operate. The FERC may impose additional price limitations, bidding rules and other mechanisms, or terminate existing price limitations from time to time. Any such action by the FERC may result in prices for electricity changing in an unanticipated direction or manner and, as a result, may have a material adverse effect on our businesses, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.

When our businesses enter into fixed-price long-term contracts to provide services or commodities, they are exposed to inflationary pressures such as rising commodity prices, and interest rate risks.

Sempra Mexico, Sempra Renewables andSempra LNG & Midstreamgenerally endeavor to secure long-term contracts with customers for services and commodities to optimize the use of their facilities, reduce volatility in earnings, and support the construction of new infrastructure. However, if these contracts are at fixed prices, the profitability of the contract may be materially adversely affected by inflationary pressures, including rising operational costs, costs of labor, materials, equipment and commodities, and rising interest rates that affect financing costs. We may try to mitigate these risks by using variable pricing tied to market indices, anticipating an escalation in costs when bidding on projects, providing for cost escalation, providing for direct pass-through of operating costs or entering into hedges. However, these measures, if implemented, may not ensure that the increase in revenues they provide will fully offset increases in operating expenses and/or financing costs. The failure to fully or substantially offset these increases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and/or results of operations.

Business development activities may not be successful and projects under construction may not commence operation as scheduled or be completed within budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.

The acquisition, development, construction and expansion of LNG terminals; natural gas, propane and ethane pipelines and storage facilities; electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities; and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks. We may be required to spend significant sums for preliminary engineering, permitting, fuel supply, resource exploration, legal, and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible, economically attractive, or capable of being built.

Success in developing a particular project is contingent upon, among other things:

▪negotiation of satisfactory engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) agreements

▪negotiation of supply and natural gas sales agreements or firm capacity service agreements

▪timely receipt of required governmental permits, licenses, authorizations, and rights of way and maintenance or extension of these authorizations

▪timely implementation and satisfactory completion of construction

▪obtaining adequate and reasonably priced financing for the project

Successful completion of a particular project may be materially adversely affected by, among other factors:

▪unforeseen engineering problems

▪construction delays and contractor performance shortfalls

▪work stoppages

▪failure to obtain, maintain or extend required governmental permits, licenses, authorizations, and rights of way

▪equipment unavailability or delay and cost increases

▪adverse weather conditions

▪environmental and geological conditions

▪litigation

▪unsettled property rights

If we are unable to complete a development project or if we have substantial delays or cost overruns, this could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.

The operation of existing and future facilities also involves many risks, including the breakdown or failure of electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities, or natural gas regasification, liquefaction and storage facilities or other equipment or processes, labor disputes, fuel interruption, environmental contamination and operating performance below expected levels. In addition, weather-related incidents and other natural disasters can disrupt generation, regasification, liquefaction, storage, transmission and distribution systems. The occurrence of any of these events could lead to our facilities being idled for an extended period of time or our facilities operating well below expected capacity levels, which may result in lost revenues or increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs and penalties. Such occurrences could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.

The design, development and construction of the Cameron LNG liquefaction facility involves numerous risks and uncertainties.

With respect to our project to add LNG export capability at the Cameron LNG facility, the Cameron LNG Holdings, LLC joint venture (Cameron LNG JV) is building an LNG export facility consisting of three liquefaction trains designed to a total nameplate capacity of

13.9

million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of LNG with an expected export capability of


Mtpa of LNG, or approximately

1.7

Bcf per day. The anticipated incremental investment in the three-train liquefaction project is estimated to be approximately

$7 billion

, including the cost of the lump-sum, turnkey construction contract, development engineering costs and permitting costs, but excluding capitalized interest and other financing costs. The total cost of the facility, including the cost of our original regasification facility contributed to the joint venture plus interest during construction, financing costs and required reserves, is estimated to be approximately

$10 billion

. If construction, financing or other project costs are higher than we currently expect, we may have to contribute additional cash exceeding our current estimates. The majority of the incremental investment in the joint venture will be project-financed and the balance provided by the project partners. Any failure by the project partners to make their required investments on a timely basis could result in project delays and could materially adversely affect the development of the project. In addition, Sempra Energy has guaranteed a maximum of

$3.9 billion

related to the project financing and financing-related agreements. These guarantees terminate upon Cameron LNG JV’s achieving “financial completion” of the initial three-train liquefaction project, including all three trains achieving commercial operation and meeting certain operational performance tests. If, due to the joint venture’s failure to satisfy the financial completion criteria, we are required to repay some or all of the

$3.9 billion

under our guarantees, any such repayments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and/or prospects.

$7 billion

of incremental investment, excluding capitalized interest and other financing costs. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and/or prospects.

We face many challenges to develop and complete our contemplated LNG export facilities.

Expansion of the Cameron LNG liquefaction facility beyond the first three trains is subject to certain restrictions and conditions under the joint venture project financing agreements, including among others, timing restrictions on expansion of the project unless appropriate prior consent is obtained from the project lenders. Under the Cameron LNG JV equity agreements, the expansion of the project requires the unanimous consent of all of the partners, including with respect to the equity investment obligation of each partner. One of the partners indicated to Sempra Energy and the other partners that it does not intend to invest additional capital in Cameron LNG JV with respect to the expansion. As a result, discussions among the partners have occurred, and we are considering a variety of options to attempt to move the expansion project forward. These activities have contributed to delays in developing firm pricing information and securing customer commitments. In light of these developments, we cannot assure you that the various consents required for expansion of the Cameron LNG project will be obtained.

There can be no assurance that our contemplated LNG export facilities will be completed, and our inability to complete one or more of our contemplated LNG export facilities could have a material adverse effect on our future cash flows, results of operations and prospects.

We discuss these projects further in “Our Business” and “Factors Influencing Future Performance” in“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Annual Report.

Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could reduce or eliminate LNG export opportunities and demand.

We cannot predict whether additional federal, state or local laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing will be enacted in the future and, if so, what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit. If additional levels of regulation or permitting requirements were imposed on hydraulic fracturing operations, natural gas prices in North America could rise, which in turn could materially adversely affect the relative pricing advantage that has existed in recent years in favor of domestic natural gas prices (based on Henry Hub pricing). Increased regulation or difficulty in permitting of hydraulic fracturing, and any corresponding increase in domestic natural gas prices, could materially adversely affect demand for LNG exports and our ability to develop commercially viable LNG export facilities beyond the three train Cameron LNG facility currently under construction.

Increased competition and changes in trade policies could materially adversely affect us.

In addition, the current U.S. Administration has previously indicated its intention to renegotiate trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. A shift in U.S. trade policies could materially adversely affect our LNG development opportunities, as well as opportunities for trade between Mexico and the United States.

We may elect not to, or may not be able to, enter into, extend or replace expiring long-term supply and sales agreements or long-term firm capacity agreements for our projects, which would subject our revenues to increased volatility and our businesses to increased competition. Such long-term contracts, once entered into, increase our credit risk if our counterparties fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis due to bankruptcy, insolvency, or otherwise.

The Energía Costa Azul LNG facility and the Cameron LNG facility (within the Cameron LNG JV) have entered into long-term capacity agreements with a limited number of counterparties at each facility. Under these agreements, customers pay capacity reservation and usage fees to receive, store and regasify the customers’ LNG. We also may enter into short-term and/or long-term supply agreements to purchase LNG to be received, stored and regasified for sale to other parties. The long-term supply agreement contracts are expected to reduce our exposure to changes in natural gas prices through corresponding natural gas sales agreements or by tying LNG supply prices to prevailing natural gas market price indices. If the counterparties, customers or suppliers to one or more of the key agreements for the LNG facilities were to fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.

At Cameron LNG JV, although the Cameron LNG terminal is partially contracted for regasification, there is a termination agreement in place that will result in the termination of the regasification contract at the point during the construction of the new liquefaction facilities where piping tie-ins to the existing regasification terminal become necessary.

For the three-train liquefaction facility currently under construction, Cameron LNG JV has 20-year liquefaction and regasification tolling capacity agreements in place with ENGIE S.A. (formerly GDF SUEZ S.A.) and affiliates of Mitsubishi Corporation and Mitsui & Co. Ltd., that subscribe for the full nameplate capacity of the facility. If the counterparties to these tolling agreements were to fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations to Cameron LNG JV on a timely basis, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.

Sempra Mexico’s andSempra LNG & Midstream’s ability to enter into or replace existing long-term firm capacity agreements for their natural gas pipeline operations are dependent on demand for and supply of LNG and/or natural gas from their transportation customers, which may include our LNG facilities. A significant sustained decrease in demand for and supply of LNG and/or natural gas from such customers could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.

December 31, 2016

was $1.5 billion. A significant impairment charge related to our natural gas storage assets would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which it is recorded.

The electric generation and wholesale power sales industries are highly competitive. As more plants are built and competitive pressures increase, wholesale electricity prices may become more volatile. Without the benefit of long-term power sales agreements, our revenues may be subject to increased price volatility, and we may be unable to sell the power that Sempra Renewables’ and Sempra Mexico’s facilities are capable of producing or to sell it at favorable prices, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.

We provide information about these matters in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Annual Report.

Our businesses depend on counterparties, business partners, customers, and suppliers performing in accordance with their agreements. If they fail to perform, we could incur substantial expenses and business disruptions and be exposed to commodity price risk and volatility, which could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.

Our businesses, and the businesses that we invest in, are exposed to the risk that counterparties, business partners, customers, and suppliers that owe money or commodities as a result of market transactions or other long-term agreements or arrangements will not perform their obligations in accordance with such agreements or arrangements. Should they fail to perform, we may be required to enter into alternative arrangements or to honor the underlying commitment at then-current market prices. In such an event, we may incur additional losses to the extent of amounts already paid to such counterparties or suppliers. In addition, many such agreements are important for the conduct and growth of our businesses. The failure of any of the parties to perform in accordance with these agreements could materially adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and/or prospects. Finally, we often extend credit to counterparties and customers. While we perform significant credit analyses prior to extending credit, we are exposed to the risk that we may not be able to collect amounts owed to us.

In November 2015, a major U.S. credit rating agency revised PEMEX’s global foreign currency and local currency credit ratings from A3 to Baa1 and changed the outlook for its credit ratings to negative. In March 2016, the same major credit rating agency further downgraded PEMEX’s global foreign currency and local currency credit ratings from Baa1 to Baa3. In May, October and December 2016, in connection with debt offerings by PEMEX, the same major credit agency reaffirmed that the outlook on PEMEX’s credit ratings remains negative. PEMEX is also subject to the control of the Mexican government, which could limit its ability to satisfy its external debt obligations. Although PEMEX is a State Productive Enterprise of Mexico, its financing obligations are not guaranteed by the Mexican government. As both a partner in a Sempra Mexico joint venture that holds a 50-percent interest in the Los Ramones Norte pipeline project and a customer with capacity contracts for transportation services on Sempra Mexico’s ethane pipelines, if PEMEX were unable to meet any or all of its obligations to Sempra Mexico, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.

Sempra Mexico’s andSempra LNG & Midstream’s obligations and those of their suppliers for LNG supplies are contractually subject to (1) suspension or termination for “force majeure” events beyond the control of the parties; and (2) substantial limitations of remedies for other failures to perform, including limitations on damages to amounts that could be substantially less than those necessary to provide full recovery of costs for breach of the agreements, which in either event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and/or prospects.

Our businesses are subject to various legal actions challenging our property rights and permits.

We are engaged in disputes regarding our title to the properties adjacent to and properties where our LNG terminal in Mexico is located, as we discuss in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report. In the event that we are unable to defend and retain title to the properties on which our LNG terminal is located, we could lose our rights to occupy and use such properties and the related terminal, which could result in breaches of one or more permits or contracts that we have entered into with respect to such terminal. In addition, our ability to convert the LNG terminal into an export facility may be hindered by these disputes, and they could make project financing such a facility and finding suitable partners and customers very difficult. If we are unable to occupy and use such properties and the related terminal, it could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.

We are also engaged in disputes regarding permits at our Energía Sierra Juárez wind project in Mexico, as we discuss in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

We rely on transportation assets and services, much of which we do not own or control, to deliver electricity and natural gas.

We depend on electric transmission lines, natural gas pipelines, and other transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to:

▪deliver the electricity and natural gas we sell to wholesale markets,

▪supply natural gas to our gas storage and electric generation facilities, and

▪provide retail energy services to customers.

Sempra Mexico andSempra LNG & Midstreamalso depend on natural gas pipelines to interconnect with their ultimate source or customers of the commodities they are transporting. Sempra Mexico andSempra LNG & Midstreamalso rely on specialized ships to transport LNG to their facilities and on natural gas pipelines to transport natural gas for customers of the facilities. Sempra Renewables, Sempra South American Utilities and Sempra Mexico rely on transmission lines to sell electricity to their customers. If transportation is disrupted, or if capacity is inadequate, we may be unable to sell and deliver our commodities, electricity and other services to some or all of our customers. As a result, we may be responsible for damages incurred by our customers, such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative electricity, natural gas supplies and LNG at then-current spot market rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.

Our international businesses are exposed to different local, regulatory and business risks and challenges.

In Mexico, we own or have interests in natural gas distribution and transportation, liquid petroleum gas storage and transportation facilities, ethane transportation, electricity generation, distribution and transmission facilities, and an LNG terminal. In Peru and Chile, we own or have interests in electricity generation, transmission and distribution facilities and operations. Developing infrastructure projects, owning energy assets, and operating businesses in foreign jurisdictions subject us to significant political, legal, regulatory and financial risks that vary by country, including:

▪changes in foreign laws and regulations, including tax and environmental laws and regulations, and U.S. laws and regulations, in each case, that are related to foreign operations

▪governance by and decisions of local regulatory bodies, including setting of rates and tariffs that may be earned by our businesses

▪high rates of inflation

▪volatility in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and currencies of the countries in which we operate, as we discuss below

▪foreign cash balances that may be unavailable to fund U.S. operations, or available only at unfavorable U.S. and/or foreign tax rates upon repatriation of such amounts or changes in tax law

▪changes in government policies or personnel

▪trade restrictions

▪limitations on U.S. company ownership in foreign countries

▪permitting and regulatory compliance

▪changes in labor supply and labor relations

▪adverse rulings by foreign courts or tribunals, challenges to permits and approvals, difficulty in enforcing contractual and property rights, and unsettled property rights and titles in Mexico and other foreign jurisdictions

▪expropriation of assets

▪adverse changes in the stability of the governments in the countries in which we operate

▪general political, social, economic and business conditions

▪compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws

▪valuation of goodwill

Our international businesses also are subject to foreign currency risks. These risks arise from both volatility in foreign currency exchange and inflation rates and devaluations of foreign currencies. In such cases, an appreciation of the U.S. dollar against a local currency could materially reduce the amount of cash and income received from those foreign subsidiaries. We may or may not choose to hedge these risks, and any hedges entered into may or may not be effective. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and inflation rates may result in significantly increased taxes in foreign countries and materially adversely affect our cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.

We discuss litigation related to Sempra Mexico’s Energía Costa Azul LNG terminal and other international energy projects in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Annual Report.

IEnova’s completed acquisitions of the remaining 50-percent interest in the Gasoductos de Chihuahua joint venture and of the Ventika wind power generation facilities will subject IEnova to integration challenges and risks.

Other Risks

Sempra Energy has substantial investments in and obligations arising from businesses that it does not control or manage or in which it shares control.

Sempra Energy makes investments in entities that we do not control or manage or in which we share control. As described above, SDG&E holds a

that reflects remaining distributions expected to be received from the RBS Sempra Commodities LLP (RBS Sempra Commodities) partnership as it is dissolved. The timing and amount of distributions may be impacted by the matters we discuss related to RBS Sempra Commodities in Notes 6 and 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report. The failure to collect all or a substantial portion of our remaining investment in the RBS Sempra Commodities partnership could have a corresponding impact on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.

Sempra Renewables andSempra LNG & Midstreamhave provided guarantees related to joint venture financing agreements, and Sempra South American Utilities and Sempra Mexico have provided loans to joint ventures in which they have investments and to other affiliates. We discuss the guarantees in Note 4, and affiliate loans in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

We have limited influence over these ventures and other businesses in which we do not have a controlling interest. In addition to the other risks inherent in these businesses, if their management were to fail to perform adequately or the other investors in the businesses were unable or otherwise failed to perform their obligations to provide capital and credit support for these businesses, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. We discuss our investments further in Notes 3, 4 and 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

Market performance or changes in other assumptions could require Sempra Energy, SDG&E and/or SoCalGas to make significant unplanned contributions to their pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

Sempra Energy, SDG&E and SoCalGas provide defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits to eligible employees and retirees. A decline in the market value of plan assets may increase the funding requirements for these plans. In addition, the cost of providing pension and other postretirement benefits is also affected by other factors, including the assumed rate of return on plan assets, employee demographics, discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations, rates of increase in health care costs, levels of assumed interest rates and future governmental regulation. An adverse change in any of these factors could cause a material increase in our funding obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.

Impairment of goodwill would negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.

As of December 31, 2016, Sempra Energy had approximately$2.4 billionof goodwill, which represented approximately4.9 percentof the total assets on its Consolidated Balance Sheet, primarily related to investments in Gasoductos de Chihuahua in Mexico, Chilquinta Energía in Chile and Luz Del Sur in Peru. Goodwill is not amortized, but we test it for impairment annually on October 1 or whenever events or changes in circumstances necessitate an evaluation, which could result in our recording a goodwill impairment loss. We discuss our annual goodwill impairment testing process and the factors considered in such testing in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations– Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” and in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report. A goodwill impairment loss could materially adversely affect our results of operations for the period in which such charge is recorded.
