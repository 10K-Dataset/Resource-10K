Item 1A.Risk Factors



RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

You should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K and in any other documents to which we refer you in this Form 10-K, before purchasing our securities.  The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.

Our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate which could negatively impact our operations, financial results, and stock price

Our operating results have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.  Results in any period could be affected by:

•changes in market demand,

•competitive market conditions,

•the timing of recognizing revenues,

•fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,

•the cost and availability of components,










•the mix of our customer base and sales channels,

•the mix of products sold,

•pricing of products,

•changes in U.S. or foreign policies on trade, taxes or spending,

•global or regional economic and political developments, and

•other risks, including those described below.

Seasonal variations in demand for our products may also affect our quarterly results.  Construction purchases tend to occur in early spring, and U.S. governmental agencies tend to utilize funds available at the end of the government’s fiscal year for additional purchases at the end of our third fiscal quarter in September of each year.   Our agricultural equipment business revenues have historically been the highest in the first quarter, followed by the second quarter, reflecting buying in anticipation of the spring planting season in the Northern hemisphere.  If we do not accurately forecast seasonal demand we may be left with unsold inventory or have a shortage of inventory, which could negatively impact our financial results.

Due in part to the buying patterns of our customers, a significant portion of our quarterly revenue occurs from orders received and immediately shipped to customers in the last few weeks and days of each quarter, while our operating expense tends to remain fairly predictable.  A majority of our sales force earns commissions on a quarterly basis which may cause concentrations of orders at the end of any fiscal quarter.  It could harm our operating results if for any reason expected sales are deferred, orders are not received, or shipments are delayed a few days at the end of a quarter.

The price of our common stock could decline substantially in the event any of these risks result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, which are based on historical and predictive models that are not necessarily accurate representations of the future.

The volatility of our stock price could adversely affect an investment in our common stock

The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.  During fiscal 2016, our stock price ranged from $18.36 to $30.84.  We believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:

•announcements and rumors of developments related to our business or the industry in which we compete, or related to the industries in which our customers compete,

•quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results and order levels,

•general conditions in the worldwide economy,

•acquisition announcements,

•new products or product enhancements announced or introduced by us or our competitors,

•disputes with respect to developments in patents or other intellectual property rights,

•security breaches,

•developments in our relationships with our partners, customers and suppliers,

•political, economic or social uncertainty, and

•acts of terrorism.

In addition, the stock market in general and the markets for shares of “high-tech” companies in particular, have frequently experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies.  Any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

Global and regional economic conditions and the cyclicality of some of our key markets may negatively impact our businesses and our operating results

Our earnings and financial position are and will continue to be influenced by various macroeconomic factors, including increases or decreases in gross domestic product, the level of consumer and business confidence and spending, changes in the interest rates on consumer and business credit, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in tax rates or policy, energy prices, changes in international trade policies and the demand for and the cost of commodities such as corn, which exist in the various countries in which we operate. During 2016, we experienced a strengthening U.S. Dollar which had the impact of making some of our products and services more expensive than many of our local competitors.  Developments with respect to trade policy and laws, treaties or international accords related to imports and exports, such as NAFTA, or tariffs or other trade barriers which could be imposed by the U.S. or by other countries, could have a material adverse effect on our or on our suppliers’ or customers’ business.

In the recent past, uncertainties in the financial and credit markets have caused our customers to postpone purchases, and negative economic conditions may reduce future sales of, or demand for, our products and services.  Negative economic conditions or changes in tax policy may depress the tax revenues of government entities, which are significant purchasers of our products.  Many










of our products are sold through dealer channels, and our dealers depend on the availability of credit both to finance purchases of our products for their inventory, and to finance purchases by their customers.  Sources of credit could disappear or the financial situation of our channel partners and customers could become such that they are no longer eligible for such financing, or financing becomes more costly.  Negative economic conditions may result in increased collection times or greater write-offs, affecting our cash flow and operating results. Our suppliers may be impacted by economic pressures, which may adversely affect their ability to fulfill their obligations to us, or result in increased prices, and therefore cause a disruption in our supply chain or impact our operating results.



Financial conditions in several regions continue to place significant economic pressures on existing and potential customers, including our dealer channels. There is ongoing concern about economic conditions in Europe, which has experienced negative impacts from sovereign debt levels and government taxing and spending actions to address such issues, as well as the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union. Other governments may continue to implement measures which may slow the economic growth rate in those countries (e.g., higher interest rates and reduced bank lending). Growth rates in key emerging markets, including China, have slowed, which could affect demand for our products, both with respect to the products we sell directly into emerging markets, and indirectly by reducing demand for our customers’ products. Falling commodity prices have also negatively affected markets such as the U.S., Canada, the Middle East and Australia.

We are subject to the cyclicality of the agricultural and engineering and construction industries, which can cause sudden (and sometimes material) declines in demand, with negative effects on sales, inventory levels and product pricing.  In general, demand in the engineering and construction industries for our products is highly correlated to the economic cycle and can be subject to even greater levels of volatility.  The agricultural spending cycle is influenced by general economic conditions as well as weather, crop loads, commodity pricing, the availability of credit and the strength of the U.S. Dollar.  Since 2014, the agricultural sector has been experiencing a significant downturn and which has had and may have a negative effect on the company’s overall growth rate.  In addition, new sources of supply and a decline in demand have resulted in a substantial decline in the price of oil and gas since 2014, and as a result, the oil and gas industry has been experiencing a significant downturn which has had and may continue to have a negative effect on our engineering and construction business.

If there is significant deterioration in the global economy, the economies of the countries or regions where our customers are located or do business, or the industries that we or our customers serve, the demand for our products and services would likely decrease and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Changes in economic conditions also make it difficult to make financial forecasts, which could cause us to miss our financial guidance and adversely affect our stock price.

We may not be able to enter into or maintain important alliances and distribution relationships

We believe that in certain business opportunities our success will depend on our ability to form and maintain alliances with industry participants, such as Caterpillar, Nikon, Hilti, and CNH Global. Our failure to form and maintain such alliances, or the preemption or disruption of such alliances by actions of competitors, will adversely affect our ability to sell our products to customers. Our relationships with substantial industry participants such as Caterpillar and CNH are complex and multifaceted, and are likely to evolve over time based upon the changing business needs and objectives of the parties. Since these strategic relationships contribute to significant ongoing business in certain of our important markets, changes in these relationships could adversely affect our sales and revenues.

We utilize dealer networks, including those affiliated with some of our strategic allies such as Caterpillar and CNH Global, to market, sell and service many of our products.  Changes in our product mix, including increasing provision of software and bundled solutions tailored to the needs of specific vertical markets, impose new demands on our distribution channels and may require significant changes in the skills and expertise required to successfully distribute our products and services, or the creation of new distribution channels.  Recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in the use and the selling of our technology and product offerings requires significant time and resources.  In order to develop and expand our distribution channels, we must continue to expand and improve our processes and procedures that support our distribution channels, including our investment in systems and training, and those processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and difficult to manage.  The time and expense required for sales and marketing organizations of our channel partners to become familiar with our product offerings, including our new product developments, and newer types of offering such as software and services, may make it more difficult to introduce those products to end-users and delay end-user adoption, which could result in lower revenues.

Disruption of dealer coverage within specific geographic or end-user markets could cause difficulties in marketing, selling or servicing our products and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.  Moreover, dealers who carry products that compete with our products may focus their inventory purchases and sales efforts on goods provided by competitors due to industry demand or profitability.  Such sourcing decisions can adversely impact our sales, financial condition and results of operations.










We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which can adversely affect our operating results

Fluctuations in currencies impact our operating results, which are reported in U.S. Dollars. A significant portion of our business is conducted outside the U.S., and as such, we face exposure to movements in the currency exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and other currencies.  These exposures may change over time as economic conditions and business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows.  During 2016, our business was negatively impacted by the strong U.S. Dollar which increased the cost of some of our products and services relative to those of local competitors in some jurisdictions.  If the U.S. Dollar remains strong or there is a continued increase in the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar against other currencies, it could negatively impact foreign demand for our products or reduce the dollar value of local currency sales.  A significant portion of our revenue is derived from countries outside of the United States.  Possible import, export, tariff and other trade barriers, which could be imposed by the U.S. or other countries, might have a material adverse effect on the business.

Currently, we routinely hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.  The hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the short term impact of currency fluctuations on certain non-functional currency assets and liabilities.  Our attempts to hedge against these risks involve transaction costs, and could be unsuccessful and expose us to losses.

Investing in and integrating new acquisitions could be costly, place a significant strain on our management systems and resources, or may fail to deliver the expected return on investment, which could negatively impact our operating results

We typically acquire a number of businesses each year, and intend to continue to acquire other businesses. Acquisitions entail numerous risks, including:

•potential inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and products or to realize cost savings or other anticipated benefits from integration;

•loss of key employees or customers of acquired operations;

•difficulty of assimilating geographically dispersed operations and personnel of the acquired companies;

•potential disruption of our business or the acquired business;

•unanticipated expenses related to acquisitions;

•unanticipated difficulties in conforming business practices, policies, procedures, internal controls, and financial records of acquisitions with our own business;

•impairment of relationships with employees, customers, vendors, distributors or business partners of either an acquired company or our own business;

•inability to accurately forecast the performance of recently acquired businesses, resulting in unforeseen adverse effects on our operating results;

•potential liabilities, including liabilities resulting from known or unknown compliance or legal issues,  associated with an acquired business; and

•negative accounting impact to our results of operations because of purchase accounting treatment and the business or accounting practices of acquired companies.



Any such effects from acquisitions could be costly and place a significant strain on our management systems and resources.



As a result of acquisitions, we have significant assets that include goodwill and other purchased intangibles. The testing of this goodwill and intangibles for impairment under established accounting guidelines requires significant use of judgment and assumptions. Changes in business conditions or in the prospects or results of operations of the acquired business could require negative adjustments to the valuation of these assets resulting in write-offs which adversely affect our results. If we divest a business and the proceeds are less than the net book value at the time, we would be forced to write off the difference. In addition, changes in the operating results or stock price of companies in which we have investments may have a direct impact on our financial statements or could result in our having to write-down the value of such investment.

Even if successfully negotiated and closed, acquisitions may not yield expected synergies, may not advance our business strategy as expected, may fall short of expected return-on-investment targets, or may not prove successful or effective for our business.  Companies that we acquire may operate with different cost and margin structures, which could further cause fluctuations in our operating results and adversely affect our operating margins.

Our internal and customer-facing systems, and systems of third parties we rely upon, may be subject to disruption, delays or cybersecurity breaches that could adversely impact our customers and operations

A cybersecurity incident in our own systems or the systems of our third party providers may compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our own internal data, the availability of our products and websites designed to support our customers, or our customer data.  Computer hackers, foreign governments or cyber terrorists may attempt to or succeed in penetrating our network security and our website.  Unauthorized access to our proprietary business information or customer data may be obtained










through break-ins, sabotage, breach of our secure network by an unauthorized party, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, employee theft or misuse, breach of the security of the networks of our third party providers, or other misconduct.  We have experienced security breaches in the past, and despite our efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our systems, it is virtually impossible to eliminate this risk.  Because the techniques used by computer hackers who may attempt to penetrate and sabotage our network security or our website change frequently, may take advantage of weaknesses in third party technology or standards of which we are unaware or that we do not control, and may not be recognized until after they have been launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate or counter these techniques.  It is also possible that unauthorized access to customer data may be obtained through inadequate use of security controls by customers, vendors or business partners.  A cybersecurity incident affecting our systems may also result in theft of our intellectual property, proprietary data or trade secrets, which would compromise our competitive position, reputation and operating results.

The systems we rely upon also remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from a number of other factors, including access to the internet, the failure of our network or software systems, or significant variability in visitor traffic on our product websites, earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, computer viruses, human error, and similar events or disruptions.  Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities.  Our systems are also subject to intentional acts of vandalism.  Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster, a decision by any of our third-party hosting providers to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons, or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could cause system interruptions and delays, and result in loss of critical data and lengthy interruptions in our services.

We rely on our information systems and those of third parties for activities such as processing customer orders, delivery of products, hosting and providing services and support to our customers, billing and tracking our customers, hosting and managing our customer data, and otherwise running our business.  Any disruptions or unexpected incompatibilities in our information systems and those of the third parties upon whom we rely could have a significant impact on our business.

An increasing portion of our revenue comes from software as a service solutions and other hosted services in which we store, retrieve, communicate and manage data which is critical to our customers’ business systems.  Disruption of our systems which support these services and solutions could cause disruptions in our customers’ systems and in the businesses that rely on these systems.  Any such disruptions could harm our reputation, create liabilities to our customers, hurt demand for our services and solutions, and negatively impact our revenues and profitability.

Our products are highly technical and may contain undetected errors, product defects, security vulnerabilities or software errors, which could result in damage to our reputation, lost revenue, diverted development resources and increased service costs, warranty claims, and litigation

Our products, including our software products, are highly technical and complex and, when deployed, may contain errors, defects or security vulnerabilities.  We must develop our products quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing market, and we have a history of frequently introducing new products.  Products and services as sophisticated as ours could contain undetected errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new models or versions are released.  Such occurrences could result in damage to our reputation, lost revenue, diverted development resources, increased customer service and support costs, warranty claims, and litigation.

We warrant that our products will be free of defect for various periods of time, depending on the product.  In addition, certain of our contracts include epidemic failure clauses.  If invoked, these clauses may entitle the customer to return or obtain credits for products and inventory, or to cancel outstanding purchase orders even if the products themselves are not defective.

Errors, viruses or bugs may be present in software or hardware that we acquire or license from third parties and incorporate into our products or in third party software or hardware that our customers use in conjunction with our products.  Our customers’ proprietary software and network firewall protections may corrupt data from our products and create difficulties in implementing our solutions.  Changes to third party software or hardware that our customers use in conjunction with our software could also render our applications inoperable.  Any errors, defects or security vulnerabilities in our products or any defects in, or compatibility issues with, any third party hardware or software or customers’ network environments discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition, loss of customers, theft of trade secrets, data or intellectual property and increased service and warranty cost, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products alone or in combination with third party hardware or software could expose them to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses, and other malicious software programs that could attack our products.  Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could harm our reputation and lead some customers to return products, to reduce or delay future purchases or use competitive products.



If we are unable to effectively manage our increasingly diverse and complex businesses and operations, our ability to generate growth and revenue from new or existing customers may be adversely affected










Because our operations are geographically diverse and increasingly complex, our personnel resources and infrastructure could become strained and our reputation in the market and our ability to successfully manage and grow our business may be adversely affected.  The size, complexity and diverse nature of our business and the expansion of our product lines and customer base have placed increased demands on our management and operations, and further growth, if any, may place additional strains on our resources in the future.  Our ability to effectively compete and to manage our planned future growth will depend on, among other things, the following:

•maintaining continuity in our senior management and key personnel,

•increasing the productivity of our existing employees,

•attracting, retaining, training and motivating our employees, particularly our technical and management personnel,

•deploying our solutions using third-party information systems, which may require changes to our applications, documentation and operational processes,

•improving our operational, financial and management controls, and

•improving our information reporting systems and procedures.

The company has increasingly diversified the nature of its businesses both organically and by acquisition.  As a result, an increasing amount of our business involves business models which require managerial techniques and skill sets which are different from those required to manage our historical core businesses.  We are increasingly selling products and solutions directly to large enterprise customers and other end users of our products.  A direct sales model requires different skills and management processes and procedures from those we have generally used in our business in the past, and may create conflicts with our channel partners.  Over the last few years we have been increasing the portion of our business associated with professional services in order to customize our solutions for the needs of individual customers.   If we are not successful in executing on these new models, our sales, revenue and financial performance may suffer.

Changes in our software and subscription businesses may negatively affect our operating results

An increasing portion of our revenue is generated through software maintenance and subscription revenue.  Our customers have no obligation to renew their agreements for our software maintenance or subscription services after the expiration of their initial contract period, which typically ranges from one to five years.  Our customer acquisition and renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including overall economic conditions, the health of their businesses, competitive offerings and customer dissatisfaction with our services.  If customers do not renew their contracts for our products, our maintenance and subscription revenue will decline and our financial results will suffer.  Any reduction in the number of licenses that we sell, even if our customer acquisition rates do not change, will have a negative impact on our future maintenance revenue growth.  Since its introduction, our software as a service delivery model has also contributed to subscription revenue.  If any of our assumptions about expenses, revenue or revenue recognition principles from these initiatives proves incorrect, or our attempts to improve efficiency are not successful, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, and our financial results will be negatively impacted.

We face substantial competition in our markets which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition

Our markets are highly competitive and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future.  Our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price, quality and performance of our products, the effectiveness of our distribution channel and direct sales force,  the level of customer service, the development of new technology and our ability to participate in emerging markets.  Within each of our markets, we encounter direct competition from other GNSS, software, optical and laser suppliers and competition may intensify from various larger U.S. and non-U.S. competitors and new market entrants, particularly from emerging markets such as China.  Our products, which commonly use GNSS for basic location information, may be subject to competition from alternative location technologies such as simultaneous location and mapping










technology

.

We are dependent on new products and services and if we are unable to successfully introduce them into the market, or to effectively compete with new, disruptive product alternatives, our customer base may decline or fail to grow as anticipated

Some of our products rely on third party technologies including open source software, so if integration or incompatibility issues arise with these technologies or these technologies become unavailable, our product and services development may be delayed, our reputation could be harmed and our business could be adversely affected

We license software, technologies and intellectual property underlying some of our software from third parties.  The third party licenses we rely upon may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and the software and technologies may not be appropriately supported, maintained or enhanced by the licensors, resulting in development delays.  Some software licenses are subject to annual renewals at the discretion of the licensors.  In some cases, if we were to breach a provision of these license agreements, the licensor could terminate the agreement immediately.  The loss of licenses to, or inability to support, maintain and enhance, any such third party software or technology could result in increased costs, or delays in software releases or updates, until such issues have been resolved.  This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects.

We also incorporate open source software into our products.  Although we monitor our use of open source software, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market or sell our products or to develop new products.  In such event, we could be required to seek licenses from third-parties in order to continue offering our products, to disclose and offer royalty-free licenses in connection with our own source code, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis, any of which could adversely affect our business.

We are dependent on proprietary technology, which could result in litigation that could divert significant valuable resources

Our future success and competitive position is dependent upon our proprietary technology, and we rely on patent, trade secret, trademark, and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property.  The patents owned or licensed by us may be invalidated,










circumvented, infringed or challenged.  The rights granted under these patents may not provide competitive advantages to us.  Any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued within the scope of the claims sought by us, if at all.

Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain our software or develop software with the same functionality or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.  Others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology, duplicate our technology or design around the patents owned by us.  In addition, effective copyright, patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in certain countries.  The steps taken by us to protect our technology might not prevent the misappropriation of such technology.

The value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many current patent filings.  Third-parties may claim that we or our customers (some of whom are indemnified by us) are infringing their intellectual property rights.  For example, individuals and groups may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from us or our customers.  The number of these claims has increased in recent years and may continue to increase in the future.  As new patents are issued or are brought to our attention by the holders of such patents, it may be necessary for us to secure a license from such patent holders, redesign our products, or withdraw products from the market.  In addition, the legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard intellectual property or to defend against litigation could become a significant expense of operations.  Any such litigation could require us to incur substantial costs and divert significant valuable resources, including the efforts of our technical and management personnel, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.

Our global operations expose us to risks and challenges associated with conducting business internationally, and our results of operations may be adversely affected by our efforts to comply with the laws of other countries, as well as U.S. laws which apply to international operations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and U.S. export control laws

In addition, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced significant governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices.  We may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business, licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence or through other methods that relevant law and regulations prohibit us from using.  Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties.

In addition to the foregoing, engaging in international business inherently involves a number of other difficulties and risks, including:

•longer payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems,

•political or economic instability,

•potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, customs charges, bureaucratic requirements and other trade barriers,

•difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations,

•differing local customer product preferences and requirements than our U.S. markets,

•difficulties protecting or procuring intellectual property rights, and

•fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.



These factors or any combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue or our overall financial performance.










Changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income in future periods

As a global company, we are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities.  Our effective tax rate is largely based on the geographic mix of earnings, statutory rates, inter-company transfer pricing, and enacted tax laws.  A number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates, including:

•the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed,

•the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with U.S. and foreign tax authorities,

•changes in our intercompany transfer pricing methodology,

•changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities,

•increases in expense not deductible for tax purposes, including transaction costs and impairments of goodwill in connection with acquisitions,

•changes in the realizability of available tax credits,

•changes in share-based compensation,

•changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws, including the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) project being conducted by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and the potential tax reform of corporate tax system in the U.S.,

•changes in generally accepted accounting principles, and

•the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes.

On October 5, 2015, the OECD released the final reports from its BEPS Action Plans. The BEPS recommendations covered a number of issues, including country-by-country reporting, permanent establishment rules, transfer pricing rules and tax treaties.  These changes, which have been or are in the process of being adopted by numerous countries, could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes.  If our effective tax rates were to increase, our operating results, cash flows or financial condition could be adversely affected.

In January 2016, the EC announced an Anti-Tax Avoidance Package containing measures to regulate certain elements of tax planning further and to boost tax transparency for consideration by the European Parliament and Council. Meanwhile, in the U.S., a number of proposals for broad reform of the corporate tax system are under evaluation by various legislative and administrative bodies.  Future tax reform resulting from these developments may result in changes to long-standing tax principles, which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities.  It is not possible to accurately determine the overall impact of such proposals on our effective tax rate at this time.



We are currently in various stages of multiple year examinations by federal, state, and foreign taxing authorities, including a review of our 2010 to 2012 tax years by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or IRS.  If the IRS or the taxing authorities of any other jurisdiction were to successfully challenge a material tax position, we could become subject to higher taxes and our earnings would be adversely affected.

Our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us

We are dependent on a specific manufacturer and assembler for many of our products and on other manufacturers, and specific suppliers of critical parts for our products










We are substantially dependent upon Flextronics International Limited as our preferred manufacturing partner for many of our GNSS products.  Under our agreement with Flextronics, we provide a twelve-month product forecast and place purchase orders with Flextronics at least thirty calendar days in advance of the scheduled delivery of products to our customers, depending on production lead time.  Although purchase orders placed with Flextronics are cancelable, the terms of the agreement would require us to purchase from Flextronics all inventory not returnable or usable by other Flextronics customers.  Accordingly, if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products, we may be unable to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity from Flextronics to meet customers’ delivery requirements or we may accumulate excess inventories, if such inventories are not usable by other Flextronics customers.  Our current contract with Flextronics continues in effect until either party gives the other ninety days written notice.

We rely on specific suppliers for a number of our critical components and on other contract manufacturers, including Benchmark Electronics and Jabil, for the manufacture, test and assembly of certain products and components.  We have experienced shortages of components in the past.  Our current reliance on specific or a limited group of suppliers and contract manufacturers involves risks, including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components, reduced control over pricing and delivery schedules, discontinuation of or increased prices for certain components, and economic conditions which may adversely impact the viability of our suppliers and contract manufacturers.  This situation may be exacerbated during any period of economic recovery or a competitive environment.  Any inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture, assemble and test such components internally could significantly delay our ability to ship our products, which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could harm our reputation and brand as well as our operating results.

We are dependent on the availability and unimpaired use of allocated bands within the radio frequency spectrum and our products may be subject to harmful interference from new or modified spectrum uses

Our GNSS technology is dependent on the use of satellite signals and on terrestrial communication bands.  International allocations of radio frequency are made by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), a specialized technical agency of the United Nations.  These allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the World Radio Communication Conference.  Each country also has regulatory authority over how each band is used in the country.  In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations.

Any ITU or local reallocation of radio frequency bands, including frequency band segmentation and sharing of spectrum, or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands, may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our customers, both of which could reduce demand for our products.  For example, the FCC has been considering proposals to repurpose spectrum adjacent to the GPS bands for terrestrial broadband wireless operations throughout the United States.  If the FCC were to permit implementation of such proposals, or similar proposals, terrestrial broadband wireless operations could create harmful interference to GPS receivers within range of such operations and impose costs to retrofit or replace affected receivers.  Similarly, other countries have considered proposals for use of frequencies used by our products as well as adjacent bands that could cause harmful interference to our products.

Many of our products use other radio frequency bands, such as the public land mobile radio bands, together with the GNSS signal, to provide enhanced GNSS capabilities, such as real-time kinematics precision.  The continuing availability of these non-GNSS radio frequencies is essential to provide enhanced GNSS products to our precision survey, agriculture, and construction machine controls markets.  In addition, transmissions and emissions from other services and equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands or in-band may impair the utility and reliability of our products.  Any regulatory changes in spectrum allocation or in allowable operating conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Many of our products rely on GNSS technology, GPS and other satellite systems, which may become degraded or inoperable and result in lost revenue

GNSS technology, GPS satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible intentional disruption.  Many of the GPS satellites currently in orbit were originally designed to have lives of 7.5 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate.  However, of the current deployment of 31 operational satellites in orbit, six have been in operation for more than 15 years, and over half have been in use for more than 7.5 years.  Repair of damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible.  If a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites.  A reduction in the number of operating satellites below the 24-satellite standard established for GPS may impair the utility of the GPS system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities.  In addition, software updates to GPS satellites and ground control segments can cause problems, and we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of such updates to mitigate these problems.










We are dependent on continued operation of GPS, the principal GNSS currently in operation.  The GPS constellation is operated by the U. S. Government, which is committed to maintenance and improvement of GPS.  If supporting policies were to change, or if user fees were imposed, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Many of our products also use signals from systems that augment GPS, such as the Wide Area Augmentation System and National Differential GPS System, and satellites transmitting signal corrections data on mobile satellite services frequencies utilized by our RTX corrections services.  Some of these augmentation systems are operated by the U.S. government and rely on continued funding and maintenance of these systems.  Any curtailment of the operating capability of these systems or limitations on access to, or use of the signals, or discontinuance of service could result in degradation of our services or product performance, with an adverse effect on our business.

Many of our products use satellite signals from the Russian GLONASS System.  Other countries, including China and India, are in the process of creating their own GNSS systems, and we either have developed or will develop products which use GNSS signals from these systems.  The European community is developing an independent radio navigation satellite system, known as Galileo.  National or European authorities may provide preferential access to signals to companies associated with their markets, including our competitors, which could harm our competitive position.  Use of non-US GNSS signals may also be subject to FCC waiver requirements and to restrictions based upon international trade or geopolitical considerations. If we are unable to develop timely and competitive commercial products using these systems, or obtain timely and equal access to service signals, this could result in lost revenue.  These authorities may also adopt protectionist measures favoring national companies who make use of their GNSS systems, to the detriment of Trimble products using the U.S. GPS system, which would harm our business.

We are subject to the impact of governmental and other similar certifications processes and regulations which could adversely affect our products and our business

We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes

We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits.  Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.  Litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes can be difficult to predict.  Management may not adequately reserve for a contingent liability, or may suffer unforeseen liabilities, which could then impact the results of a financial period.  A material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable which, if not expected, could harm our results of operations and financial condition.

Our debt could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations

On November 24, 2014, we issued Senior Notes (Notes) due December 1, 2024 in an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million.  The Notes accrue interest at a rate of 4.75% per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on December 1 and June 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2015.  When the Notes mature, we will have to expend significant resources to repay these Notes or seek to refinance them.  If we decide to refinance the Notes, we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the Notes at all, both of which may adversely affect our financial condition.

On November 24, 2014, we entered into a new five-year credit agreement with a group of lenders (the 2014 Credit Facility).  The 2014 Credit Facility provides for an unsecured revolving loan facility of $1.0 billion.  Subject to the terms of the 2014 Credit Facility, the revolving loan facility may be increased and term loan facilities may be established in an amount of up to $500.0 million. We also have two $75 million revolving credit facilities which are uncommitted and may be called by the lenders with very little notice (the Uncommitted Facilities).  At the end of fiscal 2016, our total debt was comprised primarily of Notes of










$400.0 million, a revolving loan balance of$94.0 millionunder the 2014 Credit Facility and a revolving credit line balance of$130.0 millionunder the Uncommitted Facilities.



Our outstanding indebtedness could have important consequences, such as:

•requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations and other capital resources to debt service, thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate purposes, and other cash requirements, particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward,

•increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions,

•reducing our ability to make investments and acquisitions which support the growth of the company, or to repurchase shares of our common stock,

•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes and opportunities in, our industry, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage, and

•limiting our ability to incur additional debt on acceptable terms, if at all.

There are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, the related indebtedness (and other unrelated indebtedness) could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity, and we may not be able to repay the indebtedness that becomes due.  A default under our debt instruments may also significantly affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing.

Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control.  A significant portion of our outstanding debt has interest rates which float based on prevailing interest rates.  If interest rates increase, our interest expense will also increase.

Our ability to incur additional indebtedness over time may be limited due to applicable financial covenants and restrictions, and due to the risk that significantly increasing our level of indebtedness could impact the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations, which in turn would increase the interest rates and fees that we pay in connection with our indebtedness.

Our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by war, terrorism, or civil unrest

Acts of war, acts of terrorism or civil unrest, especially any events that impact the GNSS signals or systems, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.  The threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military activity in response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism or hostilities, may involve a redeployment of the satellites used in GNSS or interruptions of the system.  Civil unrest, local conflicts, or other political instability may adversely impact regional economies, cause work stoppages, or result in limitations on business transactions with the affected foreign jurisdictions. To the extent that such interruptions result in delays or the cancellation of orders, disruption of the manufacturing or shipment of our products, or reduced demand for our products it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
