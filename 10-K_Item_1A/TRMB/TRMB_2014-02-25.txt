Item 1A.Risk Factors

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

You should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K and in any other documents to which we refer you in this Form 10-K, before purchasing our securities. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.

Our operating results in each quarter may be affected by special conditions, such as seasonality, late quarter purchases, weather, economic conditions, timing of revenue recognition, and other potential issues

Due in part to the buying patterns of our customers, a significant portion of our quarterly revenue occurs from orders received and immediately shipped to customers in the last few weeks and days of each quarter, although our operating expense tends to remain fairly predictable. Engineering and Construction purchases tend to occur in early spring, and governmental agencies tend to utilize funds available at the end of the government’s fiscal year for additional purchases at the end of our third fiscal quarter in September of each year. Concentrations of orders sometimes also occur at the end of our other two fiscal quarters. Additionally, a majority of our sales force earns commissions on a quarterly basis which may cause concentrations of orders at the end of any fiscal quarter. It could harm our operating results if for any reason expected sales are deferred, orders are not received, or shipments are delayed









a few days at the end of a quarter.  Over the last few years we have derived an increasing percentage of our revenue from software.   Revenue recognition for such sales can be complicated and if we are not able to satisfy all of the elements for recognition associated with software sales, this could impact the amount of revenue we report in any quarterly period. Additionally, due to the complexities associated with revenue recognition we may not be able to accurately forecast our non-deferred and deferred revenues, which could cause us to miss our earnings or revenue projections and consequently negatively impact our stock price.

In addition, our operations and performance depend on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of business spending. In the recent past, uncertainties in the financial and credit markets have caused our customers to postpone purchases, and negative economic conditions may reduce future sales of, or demand for, our products and services. In addition, negative economic conditions may depress the tax revenues of federal, state and local government entities, which are significant purchasers of our products. With the exception primarily of our Mobile Solutions and Advanced Devices segments, our products are generally sold through a dealer channel, and our dealers depend on the availability of credit to finance purchases of our products for their inventory. Additionally, any disruption in our supply chain could impact our ability to meet our quarterly revenue.

Customer collections are our primary source of cash. While we believe we have a strong customer base and have experienced strong collections in the past, negative economic conditions may result in increased collection times or greater write-offs, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow. Any write-off of goodwill or intangible assets could also negatively impact our financial results. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and operating results.

Investing in and integrating new acquisitions could be costly and may place a significant strain on our management systems and resources which could negatively impact our operating results

We typically acquire a number of companies each year, and intend to continue to acquire other companies. Acquisitions of companies entail numerous risks, including:

•potential inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and products or to realize cost savings or other anticipated benefits from integration,

•loss of key employees of acquired operations,

•the difficulty of assimilating geographically dispersed operations and personnel of the acquired companies,

•the potential disruption of our ongoing business,

•unanticipated expense related to acquisitions; including significant transactions costs which under the current accounting rules, are required to be expensed rather than capitalized,

•unanticipated difficulties in conforming policies, procedures, internal controls, and financial records of acquisitions with our own business,

•the impairment of relationships with employees and customers of either an acquired company or our own business, and

•the potential unknown liabilities, including liabilities resulting from unknown compliance issues,  associated with an acquired business.

As a result of such acquisitions, we have significant assets that include goodwill and other purchased intangibles. The testing of this goodwill and intangibles for impairment under established accounting guidelines requires significant use of judgment and assumptions. Changes in business conditions could require adjustments to the valuation of these assets. In addition, losses incurred by a company in which we have an investment may have a direct impact on our financial statements or could result in our having to write-down the value of such investment. Any such problems in integration or adjustments to the value of the assets acquired could harm our growth strategy, and could be costly and place a significant strain on our management systems and resources.  Companies that we acquire may operate with different cost and margin structures, which could further cause fluctuations in our operating results and adversely affect our operating margins.

We face competition in our markets which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition

Our markets are highly competitive and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future. Our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price, quality and performance of our products, the level of customer service, the development of new technology and our ability to participate in emerging markets. Within each of our markets, we encounter direct competition from other GNSS, software, optical and laser suppliers and competition may intensify from various larger U.S. and non-U.S. competitors and new market entrants, particularly from emerging markets such as China and India.  In addition, as we sell an increasing amount of software and subscription services, we face competition from a group









of large well established companies with whom we have not previously competed.  This may require us to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes that we have not previously been exposed to, including those related to cloud computing, mobile devices and new computing platforms.  The competition in the future may, in some cases, result in price reductions, reduced margins or loss of market share, any of which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition. We believe that our ability to compete successfully in the future against existing and additional competitors will depend largely on our ability to execute our strategy to provide systems and products with significantly differentiated features compared to currently available products. We may not be able to implement this strategy successfully, and our products may not be competitive with other technologies or products that may be developed by our competitors, many of whom have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales, and other resources than we do.

We may not be able to enter into or maintain important alliances and distribution relationships

We believe that in certain business opportunities our success will depend on our ability to form and maintain alliances with industry participants, such as Caterpillar, Nikon and CNH Global. Our failure to form and maintain such alliances, or the pre-emption of such alliances by actions of competitors, will adversely affect our ability to sell our products to customers. We also utilize dealer networks, including those affiliated with some of our strategic allies such as Caterpillar and CNH Global, to market, sell and service some of our products.  Our relationships with substantial partners such as Caterpillar and CNH are complex and multifaceted, and may be subject to change based upon the business needs and objectives of the parties. Since these strategic relationships account for significant ongoing business in certain of our important markets, changes in these relationships could adversely affect our sales and revenues. Disruption of dealer coverage within a specific geographic market could cause difficulties in marketing, selling or servicing our products and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. Moreover, dealers who carry products that compete with our products may focus their inventory purchases and sales efforts on goods provided by competitors due to industry demand or profitability. Such inventory adjustments and sourcing decisions can adversely impact our sales, financial condition and results of operations.

Changes in our product mix, including increasing provision of software and bundled solutions tailored to the needs of specific vertical markets, impose new demands on our distribution channels and may require significant changes in the skills and expertise required to successfully distribute our products and services, or the creation of new distribution channels.  Recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in the use of our technology and product offerings requires significant time and resources. In order to develop and expand our distribution channels, we must continue to expand and improve our processes and procedures that support our channel, including our investment in systems and training, and those processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and difficult to manage. The time and expense required for sales and marketing organizations of our channel partners to become familiar with our product offerings, including our new product developments, may make it more difficult to introduce those products to end-users and delay end-user adoption of our product offerings, which could result in lower revenues.

We are increasingly selling products and solutions directly to large enterprise customers.  A direct sales model requires different skills and management processes and procedures from those we have generally used in our business in the past, and may create conflicts with our channel partners.  If we are not successful in executing a direct sales model or in managing conflict with our channel partners, our sales and revenue may suffer.

Our information systems or those of our outside vendors may be subject to disruption, delays or security incidents that could adversely impact our customers and operations

We rely on our information systems and those of third parties for things such as processing customer orders, delivery of products, providing services and support to our customers, billing and tracking our customers, hosting and managing customer data, and otherwise running our business. Any disruption in our information systems and those of the third parties upon whom we rely could have a significant impact on our business.

A security incident in our own systems or the systems of our third party providers may compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our own internal data, the availability of our products and websites designed to support our customers, or our customer data. Computer hackers, foreign governments or cyber terrorists may attempt to penetrate our network security and our website. Unauthorized access to our proprietary business information or customer data may be obtained through break-ins, sabotage, breach of our secure network by an unauthorized party, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, employee theft or misuse, breach of the security of the networks of our third party providers, or other misconduct. Because the techniques used by computer programmers who may attempt to penetrate and sabotage our network security or our website change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques. It is also possible that unauthorized access to customer data may be obtained through inadequate use of security controls by customers.

While our products and services provide and support strong password controls, IP restriction and other security mechanisms, the use of such mechanisms are controlled in many cases by our customers. We may also experience delays or interruptions caused









by a number of factors, including access to the internet, the failure of our network or software systems, or significant variability in visitor traffic on our product websites. It is also possible that hardware or software failures or errors in our systems, or in those of our third party providers, could result in data loss or corruption or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our customers regard as significant. These failures and interruptions could harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers.

Our systems also remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, human error, and similar events or disruptions. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities. Our systems are also subject to intentional acts of vandalism. Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster, a decision by any of our third-party hosting providers to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons, or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could cause system interruptions and delays, and result in loss of critical data and lengthy interruptions in our services.

An increasing portion of our revenue comes from software as a service solutions and other hosted services in which we host, store, retrieve and manage the communication of data which is critical to our customers’ business systems.  Disruption of our systems which support these services and solutions could cause disruptions in our customers’ systems and in the businesses that rely on these systems.  Any such disruptions could harm our reputation, create liabilities to our customers, hurt demand for our services and solutions, and negatively impact our revenues and profitability.

Many of our products rely on GNSS technology, GPS and other satellite systems, which may become degraded or inoperable and result in lost revenue

GNSS technology, GPS satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible intentional disruption.  Many of the GPS satellites currently in orbit were originally designed to have lives of 7.5 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate. However, of the current deployment of 31 satellites in place, nearly one third have already been in operation for more than 15 years. Repair of damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible. If a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites. A reduction in the number of operating satellites below the 24-satellite standard established for GPS may impair the utility of the GPS system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities. GPS satellites and ground control segments are being modernized. GPS modernization software updates can cause problems. We depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of GPS updates.

As the principal GNSS currently in operation, we are dependent on continued operation of GPS. GPS is operated by the U. S. Government, which is committed to maintenance and improvement of GPS; however if the policy were to change, and GPS were no longer supported by the U. S. Government, or if user fees were imposed, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Many of our products also use signals from systems that augment GPS, such as the Wide Area Augmentation System and National Differential GPS System, and satellites transmitting signal corrections data on mobile satellite services frequencies utilized by our Omnistar corrections services. Some of these augmentation systems are operated by the federal government and rely on continued funding and maintenance of these systems. In addition, some of our products also use satellite signals from the Russian GLONASS System. Any curtailment of the operating capability of these systems or limitations on access to, or use of the signals, or discontinuance of service could result in decreased user capability thereby impacting our markets.

The European community is developing an independent radio navigation satellite system, known as Galileo. Although we have a commercial license to market and sell receivers capable of receiving the Galileo open service signals, European authorities in the future may decide to offer other premium or encrypted service signals under different licenses or provide preferential access to European companies, including our competitors.  Even though a fully operational Galileo system is several years away, if we are unable to develop timely and competitive commercial products using the system, or obtain a timely license to future Galileo service signals, it could result in lost revenue which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.

We may be unable to replace lost revenue due to customer cancellations or renewals at lower rates

An increasing portion of our revenue is generated through software maintenance and subscription revenue. Decreases in maintenance or subscription attach or renewal rates or a decrease in the number of new licenses or hardware sold with subscription services could negatively impact our future revenue and financial results.

Our customers have no obligation to renew their agreements for our software maintenance or subscription services after the expiration of their initial contract period, which range from one to five years.  Our customers' attach and renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the overall global economy, the health of their businesses and customer









dissatisfaction with our services.  If customers do not renew their contracts for our products, our maintenance and subscription revenue will decline and our financial results will suffer.

A portion of the growth of our maintenance revenue has typically been associated with growth of the number of licenses that we sell. Any reduction in the number of licenses that we sell, even if our customers' attach rates do not change, will have a negative impact on our future maintenance revenue growth.  In addition, a portion of the growth of our subscription revenue has typically been associated with the growth in the number of hardware sales that we sell in conjunction with the subscription services.  Any reduction in the number of hardware sales will have a negative impact on our future subscription service growth.  Since its introduction, our software as service delivery model has also contributed to subscription revenue. If any of our assumptions about expenses, revenue or revenue recognition principles from these initiatives proves incorrect, or our attempts to improve efficiency are not successful, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, and our financial results will be negatively impacted.

Changes to our licensing or subscription renewal programs, or bundling of our products, could negatively impact the timing of our recognition of revenue.

We continually re-evaluate our licensing programs and subscription renewal programs, including specific license models, delivery methods, and terms and conditions, to market our current and future products and services.  We could implement different licensing models in certain circumstances, for which we would recognize licensing fees over a longer period. Over the last few years, we have increasingly offered additional products in a software as a service model. Software as a service revenues are recognized ratably over the subscription period. Any significant increase in the percentage of our business generated from such a subscription model, could increase the amount of revenue to be recognized over time as opposed to upfront, which could delay revenue recognition and have a negative impact on our operating results. In addition, changes to our licensing programs and subscription renewal programs, including the timing of the release of enhancements, upgrades, maintenance releases, the term of the contract, discounts, promotions and other factors, could impact the timing of the recognition of revenue for our products, related enhancements and services and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.

Changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income in future periods

A number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates, including:

•the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed,

•the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with US and foreign tax authorities,

•changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities,

•increases in expense not deductible for tax purposes, including transaction costs and impairments of goodwill in connection with acquisitions,

•changes in the realizability of available tax credits,

•changes in share-based compensation,

•changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws, and changes in generally accepted accounting principles, and

•the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes.

We are currently in various stages of multiple year examinations by federal, state, and foreign taxing authorities, including a review of our 2010 and 2011 tax years by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or IRS. Our effective tax rate is based on the geographic mix of earnings, statutory rates, inter-company transfer pricing, and enacted tax laws. If the IRS or the taxing authorities of any other jurisdiction were to successfully challenge a material tax position, we could become subject to higher taxes and our earnings would be adversely affected.

We are dependent on the availability and unimpaired use of allocated bands within the radio frequency spectrum

Our GNSS technology is dependent on the use of satellite signals and on terrestrial communication bands. International allocations of radio frequency are made by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), a specialized technical agency of the United Nations. These allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the World Radio Communication Conference. Each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations.

Any ITU or local reallocation of radio frequency bands, including frequency band segmentation and sharing of spectrum, or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands, may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of









our products and have significant negative impacts on our customers, both of which could reduce demand for our products.  For example, the FCC has been considering proposals  to repurpose spectrum adjacent to the GPS bands for terrestrial broadband wireless operations throughout the United States. If the FCC were to permit implementation of such proposals, or similar proposals, terrestrial broadband wireless operations could create harmful interference to GPS receivers within range of such operations and impose costs to retrofit or replace affected receivers.

Many of our products use other radio frequency bands, such as the public land mobile radio bands, together with the GNSS signal, to provide enhanced GNSS capabilities, such as real-time kinematics precision. The continuing availability of these non-GNSS radio frequencies is essential to provide enhanced GNSS products to our precision survey, agriculture, and construction machine controls markets. In addition, emissions from other services and equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands or in-band may impair the utility and reliability of our products. Any regulatory changes in spectrum allocation or in allowable operating conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Our debt could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations

On November 21, 2012, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with a group of lenders (the “2012 Credit Facility”). This credit facility provides for unsecured credit facilities in the aggregate principal amount of $1.4 billion, comprised of a five-year revolving loan facility of $700.0 million and a five-year $700.0 million term loan facility. Subject to the terms of the 2012 Credit Facility, the revolving loan facility may be increased, and/or additional term loan commitments may be established, in an aggregate principal amount up to $300.0 million. Additionally, we have two $75 million uncommitted revolving loan facilities which are callable by the bank at any time and have no covenants. At the end of fiscal2013, our total debt was comprised primarily of a term loan of$665.0 millionand a revolving credit line of $22.0 million under the 2012 Credit Facility and a revolving credit line of $63.0 million under the Uncommitted Facilities. Debt incurred under this agreement could have important consequences, such as:

•requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations and other capital resources to debt service, thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and other cash requirements,

•increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions,

•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes and opportunities in, our industry, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage, and

•limiting our ability to incur additional debt on acceptable terms, if at all.

Additionally, if we were to default under our amended credit agreement and were unable to obtain a waiver for such a default, interest on the obligations would accrue at an increased rate and the lenders could accelerate our obligations under the amended credit agreement. That acceleration will be automatic in the case of bankruptcy and insolvency events of default. Additionally, our subsidiaries that have guaranteed the amended credit agreement could be required to pay the full amount of our obligations under the amended credit agreement. Any such enforcement action on the part of the lenders against us or our subsidiaries would harm our financial condition.

We are subject to the impact of governmental and other similar certifications processes and regulations which could adversely affect our products and our business

We market certain products that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold. For example, CE certification for radiated emissions is required for most GNSS receiver and data communications products sold in the European community. In the future, U.S. governmental authorities may propose GPS receiver testing and certification for compliance with published GPS signal interface or other specifications. An inability to obtain any such certifications in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our operating results. Governmental authorities may also propose other forms of GPS receiver performance standards, which may limit design alternatives, hamper product innovation or impose additional costs. Some of our products that use integrated radio communication technology require product type certification and some products require an end-user to obtain licensing from the FCC for frequency-band usage. These are secondary licenses that are subject to certain restrictions. An inability or delay in obtaining such certifications or changes to the rules by the FCC could adversely affect our ability to bring our products to market which could harm our customer relationships and therefore, our operating results. Any failure to obtain the requisite certifications could also harm our operating results.

We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and although we hedge against these risks, our attempts to hedge could be unsuccessful and expose us to losses

A significant portion of our business is conducted outside the U.S., and as such, we face exposure to movements in non-U.S. currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse









impact on our financial results and cash flows. Fluctuations in currencies impact our operating results, which are reported in US Dollars.

Currently, we routinely hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. The hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain non-functional currency assets and liabilities. Our attempts to hedge against these risks could be unsuccessful and expose us to losses.

Our inability to accurately predict orders and shipments may subject our results of operations to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter

We have not been able in the past to consistently predict when our customers will place orders and request shipments so we cannot always accurately plan our manufacturing requirements. As a result, if orders and shipments differ from what we predict, we may incur additional expense and build excess inventory, which may require additional reserves and allowances. Accordingly, we have limited visibility into future changes in demand and our results of operations may be subject to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter.

We are dependent on a specific manufacturer and assembler for many of our products and on other manufacturers, and specific suppliers of critical parts for our products

We are substantially dependent upon Flextronics International Limited as our preferred manufacturing partner for many of our GNSS products. Under the agreement, we provide to Flextronics a twelve-month product forecast and place purchase orders with Flextronics at least thirty calendar days in advance of the scheduled delivery of products to our customers, depending on production lead time. Although purchase orders placed with Flextronics are cancelable, the terms of the agreement would require us to purchase from Flextronics all inventory not returnable or usable by other Flextronics customers. Accordingly, if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products, we may be unable to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity from Flextronics to meet customers’ delivery requirements or we may accumulate excess inventories, if such inventories are not usable by other Flextronics customers. Our current contract with Flextronics continues in effect until either party gives the other ninety days written notice.

We rely on specific suppliers for a number of our critical components and on other contract manufacturers, including Benchmark Electronics and Jabil, for the manufacture, test and assembly of certain products and components. We have experienced shortages of components in the past. Our current reliance on specific or a limited group of suppliers and contract manufacturers involves risks, including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components, reduced control over pricing and delivery schedules, discontinuation of certain components, and economic conditions which may adversely impact the viability of our suppliers and contract manufacturers. This situation may be exacerbated during any period of economic recovery or a competitive environment. Any inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture, assemble and test such components internally could significantly delay our ability to ship our products, which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could harm our reputation and brand as well as our operating results.

We are subject to the SEC's new rules regarding the use and disclosure of conflict minerals, which we expect will increase our operating and compliance costs and could potentially harm our reputation, causing a decline in our stock price.

The SEC adopted its final rule implementing Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act concerning conflict minerals during August 2012. The goal of the rule is to cut direct and indirect funding of groups engaged in armed conflict and human rights abuses. We are committed to compliance with the SEC's Conflict Minerals Rule and support its intended objective. This new rule requires us to: (1) determine whether conflict minerals (tin, tantalum, tungsten, gold or similar derivatives) are used in our products and, if so, determine if the minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) or its immediately adjoining countries; and (2), if so, conduct due diligence regarding the source and chain of custody of these conflict minerals to determine whether the conflict minerals financed or benefitted armed groups. The rule will require us to submit forms and reports to the SEC by May 31, 2014 and annually thereafter that disclose our determinations and due diligence measures.

Trimble does not directly purchase any conflicts minerals.  Tracing these materials back to their country of origin is a complex task that may require us to, among other things, survey suppliers in our supply chain to understand what programs they have in place for tracing the source of minerals supplied to us or used in products supplied to us and to ensure that reasonable due diligence has been performed.  Presently, we have not determined how many or if any of our supply chain partners use conflict minerals.  In addition to the increased administrative expense required to comply with the new requirements that apply to us, we may face a limited pool of suppliers who can provide us “conflict-free” components, parts and manufactured products, and we may not be able to obtain conflict-free products or supplies in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices for our operations, and may be









required to disclose that our products are not “conflict free.”  This could adversely affect the Company’s reputation and may harm its relationships with business partners and customers, and our stock price could suffer as a result.

Our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate which could negatively impact our operations and our stock price

Our operating results have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Results in any period could be affected by:

•changes in market demand,

•competitive market conditions,

•the timing of recognizing revenues,

•fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,

•the cost and availability of components,

•the mix of our customer base and sales channels,

•the mix of products sold,

•pricing of products,

•our ability to expand our sales and marketing organization effectively,

•our ability to attract and retain key technical and managerial employees, and

•general global economic conditions.

In addition, demand for our products in any quarter or year may vary due to the seasonal buying patterns of our customers in the agricultural and engineering and construction industries. The price of our common stock could decline substantially in the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, which are based primarily on historical models that are not necessarily accurate representations of the future.

We are dependent on new products and services and if we are unable to successfully introduce them into the market, or to effectively compete with new, disruptive product alternatives, our customer base may decline or fail to grow as anticipated

We are dependent on proprietary technology, which could result in litigation that could divert significant valuable resources

Our future success and competitive position is dependent upon our proprietary technology, and we rely on patent, trade secret, trademark, and copyright law to protect our intellectual property. The patents owned or licensed by us may be invalidated, circumvented, infringed and challenged. The rights granted under these patents may not provide competitive advantages to us. Any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued within the scope of the claims sought by us, if at all.









Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain our software or develop software with the same functionality or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology, duplicate our technology or design around the patents owned by us. In addition, effective copyright, patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in certain countries. The steps taken by us to protect our technology might not prevent the misappropriation of such technology.

The value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many current patent filings. Third-parties may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. For example, individuals and groups may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from us or our customers. The number of these claims has increased in recent periods and may continue to increase in the future. We recognize that as new patents are issued or are brought to our attention by the holders of such patents, it may be necessary for us to withdraw products from the market, take a license from such patent holders, or redesign our products. In addition, the legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard intellectual property or to defend against litigation could become a significant expense of operations. Any such litigation could require us to incur substantial costs and divert significant valuable resources, including the efforts of our technical and management personnel, which harm our results of operations and financial condition.

Our products may contain undetected errors, product defects or software errors, which could result in damage to our reputation, lost revenue, diverted development resources and increased service costs, warranty claims, and litigation

We warrant that our products will be free of defect for various periods of time, depending on the product. In addition, certain of our contracts include epidemic failure clauses. If invoked, these clauses may entitle the customer to return or obtain credits for products and inventory, or to cancel outstanding purchase orders even if the products themselves are not defective.

We must develop our products quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing market, and we have a history of frequently introducing new products. Products and services as sophisticated as ours could contain undetected errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new models or versions are released. In general, our products may not be free from errors or defects after commercial shipments have begun, which could result in damage to our reputation, lost revenue, diverted development resources, increased customer service and support costs, warranty claims, and litigation.

Our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by war, terrorism, or civil unrest

Acts of war, acts of terrorism, cyber-attacks, or other circumstances of civil unrest, especially any directed at the GNSS signals or systems, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. The threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may invoke a redeployment of the satellites used in GNSS or interruptions of the system. Civil unrest or other political activities may impact regional economies through work stoppages and limitations on foreign business transactions. To the extent that such interruptions result in delays or cancellations of orders, or the manufacture or shipment of our products, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Our products are highly technical and could contain errors, defects or security vulnerabilities. In addition, our information systems or those of our outside vendors may be subject to disruption, delays or security incidents that could adversely impact our customers and operations









Some of our products rely on third party technologies including open source software, so if integration or incompatibility issues arise with these technologies or these technologies become unavailable, our product and services development may be delayed, our reputation could be harmed and our business could be adversely affected

We license software, technologies and patents underlying some of our software from third parties, The third party licenses we rely upon may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and the software and technologies may not be appropriately supported, maintained or enhanced by the licensors, resulting in development delays. Some  software licenses are subject to annual renewals at the discretion of the licensors. In many cases, if we were to breach a provision of these license agreements, the licensor could terminate the agreement immediately.  The loss of licenses to, or inability to support, maintain and enhance, any such third party software or technology could result in increased costs, or delays in software releases or updates, until such issues have been resolved. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects.

We also incorporate open source software into our products. Although we monitor our use of open source closely, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market or sell our products or to develop new products. In such event, we could be required to seek licenses from third-parties in order to continue offering our products, to disclose and offer royalty-free licenses in connection with our own source code, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis, any of which could adversely affect our business.

The volatility of our stock price could adversely affect an investment in our common stock

The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. During fiscal 2013, our stock price ranged from $24.66 to $35.01. We believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:

•announcements and rumors of developments related to our business or the industry in which we compete,

•quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results and order levels,

•general conditions in the worldwide economy,

•acquisition announcements,

•new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors,

•developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation,

•developments in our relationships with our customers and suppliers, and

•any significant acts of terrorism.

In addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of “high-tech” companies in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. Any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and the market price of our common stock may decline.

Our global operations expose us to risks and challenges associated with conducting business internationally, and our results of operations may be adversely affected by our efforts to comply with U.S. laws which apply to international operations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and US export control laws, as well as the laws of other countries









countries and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results.

In addition, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced significant governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business, licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence or through other methods that U.S. law and regulations prohibit us from using. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties.  Additional challenges for a U.S. company operating in some regions are posed by external extremist parties,  in some circumstances as a means to promote political ends.

In addition to the foregoing, engaging in international business inherently involves a number of other difficulties and risks, including:

•longer payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems,

•political and economic instability,

•potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, customs charges, bureaucratic requirements and other trade barriers,

•difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations,

•differing local customer product preferences and requirements than our U.S. markets,

•difficulties protecting or procuring intellectual property rights, and

•fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

These factors or any combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue or our overall financial performance.
