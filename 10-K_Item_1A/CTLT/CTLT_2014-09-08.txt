ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS

If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected. Additional risks or uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also impair our business operations.

Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry

We participate in a highly competitive market and increased competition may adversely affect our business.

We operate in a market that is highly competitive. We compete on several fronts, both domestically and internationally, including competing with other companies that provide similar offerings to pharmaceutical, biotechnology and consumer health companies based in North America, Latin America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. We also may compete with the internal operations of those pharmaceutical, biotechnology and consumer health manufacturers that choose to source these offerings internally, where possible.

We face material competition in each of our markets. Competition is driven by proprietary technologies and know-how, capabilities, consistency of operational performance, quality, price, value and speed. Some competitors may have greater financial, research and development, operational and marketing resources than we do.  Competition may also increase as additional companies enter our markets or use their existing resources to compete directly with ours. Expanded competition from companies in low-cost jurisdictions, such as India and China, may in the future impact our results of operations or limit our growth. Greater financial, research and development, operational and marketing resources may allow our competitors to respond more quickly with new, alternative or emerging technologies. Changes in the nature or extent of our customer requirements may render our offerings obsolete or non-competitive and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

The demand for our offerings depends in part on our customers’ research and development and the clinical and market success of their products. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed if our customers spend less on, or are less successful in, these activities.

Our customers are engaged in research, development, production and marketing of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and consumer health products. The amount of customer spending on research, development, production and marketing, as well as the outcomes of such research, development, and marketing activities, have a large impact on our sales and profitability, particularly the amount our customers choose to spend on our offerings. Our customers determine the amounts that they will spend based upon, among other things, available resources and their need to develop new products, which, in turn, is dependent upon a number of factors, including their competitors’ research, development and production initiatives, and the anticipated market uptake, clinical and reimbursement scenarios for specific products and therapeutic areas. In addition, consolidation in the industries in which our customers operate may have an impact on such spending as customers integrate acquired operations, including research and development departments and their budgets. Our customers finance their research and development spending from private and public sources. A reduction in spending by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If our customers are not successful in attaining or retaining product sales due to market conditions, reimbursement issues or other factors, our results of operations may be materially impacted.

We are subject to product and other liability risks that could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.

We are subject to significant product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of our offerings. We may be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits, which may allege that our offerings have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to consumers. Such lawsuits could be costly to defend and could result in reduced sales, significant liabilities and diversion of management’s time, attention and resources. Even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees. Beginning in 2006, we were named in a number of civil lawsuits relating to the prescription acne medication Amnesteem®, all but one of which have been dismissed or settled without our being required to make any contribution toward any settlement to date. We may be named in similar lawsuits in the future. See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings.”

Furthermore, product liability claims and lawsuits, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers. We have historically sought to manage this risk through the combination of product liability insurance and contractual indemnities and liability limitations in our agreements with customers and vendors. The availability of product liability insurance for companies in the pharmaceutical industry is generally more limited than insurance available to companies in other industries. Insurance carriers providing product











liability insurance to those in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries generally limit the amount of available policy limits, require larger self-insured retentions and exclude coverage for certain products and claims. We maintain product liability insurance with annual aggregate limits in excess of $25 million. There can be no assurance that a successful product liability claim or other liability claim would be adequately covered by our applicable insurance policies or by any applicable contractual indemnity or liability limitations.

Failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

The healthcare industry is highly regulated. We are subject to various local, state, federal, foreign and transnational laws and regulations, which include the operating and security standards of the DEA, the FDA, various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, the DHHS, the EU member states and other comparable agencies and, in the future, any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning good manufacturing practices and drug safety. Our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of the DEA, the FDA, the DHHS, foreign agencies including the EMA, and other various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing and sale.

The manufacture, distribution and marketing of our offerings for use in our customers’ products are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the FDA, the DEA, the EMA, and other equivalent local, state, federal and foreign regulatory authorities. Failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of these regulatory authorities could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil or criminal sanctions, or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals, including those relating to products or facilities. In addition, such a failure could expose us to contractual or product liability claims as well as contractual claims from our customers, including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, the cost of which could be significant.

In addition, any new offerings or products must undergo lengthy and rigorous clinical testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated by the FDA, the EMA and other equivalent local, state, federal and foreign regulatory authorities. We or our customers may elect to delay or cancel anticipated regulatory submissions for current or proposed new products for any number of reasons.

Although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion concerning the compliance of our operations with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits, licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain, without significant delay, future permits, licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses. Any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Failure to provide quality offerings to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business and subject us to regulatory actions and costly litigation.

Our results depend on our ability to execute and improve when necessary our quality management strategy and systems, and effectively train and maintain our employee base with respect to quality management. Quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements, preventing defects and improving our offerings. While we have a network of quality systems throughout our business units and facilities which relate to the design, formulation, development, manufacturing, packaging, sterilization, handling, distribution and labeling of our customers’ products which use our offerings, quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our offerings. A quality or safety issue could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and may subject us to regulatory actions, including product recalls, product seizures, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, or civil sanctions, including monetary sanctions and criminal actions. In addition, such an issue could subject us to costly litigation, including claims from our customers for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, the cost of which could be significant.

The services and offerings we provide are highly exacting and complex, and if we encounter problems providing the services or support required, our business could suffer.

The offerings we provide are highly exacting and complex, particularly in our Medication Delivery Solutions segment, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. From time to time, problems may arise in connection with facility operations or during preparation or provision of an offering, in both cases for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, equipment malfunction, sterility variances or failures, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, environmental











factors and damage to, or loss of, manufacturing operations due to fire, flood or similar causes. Such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches, requiring the destruction of product, or could halt facility production altogether. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, reimbursement to customers for lost active pharmaceutical ingredients, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. Production problems in our drug and biologic manufacturing operations could be particularly significant because the cost of raw materials is often higher than in our other businesses. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. In addition, such risks may be greater at facilities that are new or going through significant expansion or renovation.

Our global operations are subject to a number of economic, political and regulatory risks.

We conduct our operations in various regions of the world, including North America, South America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Global economic and regulatory developments affect businesses such as ours in many ways. Our operations are subject to the effects of global competition, including potential competition from manufacturers in low-cost jurisdictions such as India and China. Local jurisdiction risks include regulatory risks arising from local laws. Our global operations are also affected by local economic environments, including inflation and recession. Political changes, some of which may be disruptive, can interfere with our supply chain and customers and some or all of our activities in a particular location. While some of these risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial instruments and some are insurable, such attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful. Also, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can impact our consolidated financial results.



If we do not enhance our existing or introduce new technology or service offerings in a timely manner, our offerings may become obsolete over time, customers may not buy our offerings and our revenue and profitability may decline.

The healthcare industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Demand for our offerings may change in ways we may not anticipate because of such evolving industry standards as well as a result of evolving customer needs that are increasingly sophisticated and varied and the introduction by others of new offerings and technologies that provide alternatives to our offerings. Several of our higher margin offerings are based on proprietary technologies. The patents for these technologies will ultimately expire, and these offerings may become subject to competition. Without the timely introduction of enhanced or new offerings, our offerings may become obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. For example, if we are unable to respond to changes in the nature or extent of the technological or other needs of our pharmaceutical customers through enhancing our offerings, our competition may develop offering portfolios that are more competitive than ours and we could find it more difficult to renew or expand existing agreements or obtain new agreements. Innovations directed at continuing to offer enhanced or new offerings generally will require a substantial investment before we can determine their commercial viability, and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund these innovations.

The success of enhanced or new offerings will depend on several factors, including our ability to:

•properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs, including increasing demand for lower cost products;

•enhance, innovate, develop and manufacture new offerings in an economical and timely manner;

•differentiate our offerings from competitors’ offerings;

•achieve positive clinical outcomes for our customers’ new products;

•meet safety requirements and other regulatory requirements of government agencies;

•obtain valid and enforceable intellectual property rights; and

•avoid infringing the proprietary rights of third parties.

Even if we succeed in creating enhanced or new offerings from these innovations, they may still fail to result in commercially successful offerings or may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development, and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of offerings embodying new technologies or features. Finally, innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things, entrenched patterns of clinical practice, the need for regulatory clearance and uncertainty over market access or government or third-party reimbursement.

We and our customers depend on patents, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property protections, however, these protections may not be adequate.

We rely on a combination of know-how, trade secrets, patents, copyrights and trademarks and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect a number of our offerings and intangible assets. These proprietary rights are important to our ongoing operations. There can be no assurance that these protections will











prove meaningful against competitive offerings or otherwise be commercially valuable or that we will be successful in obtaining additional intellectual property or enforcing our intellectual property rights against unauthorized users. Our exclusive rights under certain of our offerings are protected by patents, some of which are subject to expire in the near term. When patents covering an offering expire, loss of exclusivity may occur and this may force us to compete with third parties, thereby affecting our revenue and profitability. We do not currently expect any material loss of revenue to occur as a result of the expiration of any Catalent patent.



Our proprietary rights may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. We have in the past been subject to patent oppositions before the European Patent Office and we may in the future be subject to patent oppositions in Europe or other jurisdictions in which we hold patent rights. In addition, in the future, we may need to take legal actions to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. The outcome of any such legal action may be unfavorable to us.

These legal actions regardless of outcome might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our proprietary and confidential information, there can be no assurance that our confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements will not be breached, our trade secrets will not otherwise become known by competitors or that we will have adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of proprietary information. Even if the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property is upheld, a court might construe our intellectual property not to cover the alleged infringement. In addition, intellectual property enforcement may be unavailable in some foreign countries. There can be no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology or that third parties will not design around our patent claims to produce competitive offerings. The use of our technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business.

We have applied in the United States and certain foreign countries for registration of a number of trademarks, service marks and patents, some of which have been registered or issued, and also claim common law rights in various trademarks and service marks. In the past, third parties have opposed our applications to register intellectual property and there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future. It is possible that in some cases we may be unable to obtain the registrations for trademarks, service marks and patents for which we have applied and a failure to obtain trademark and patent registrations in the United States or other countries could limit our ability to protect our trademarks and proprietary technologies and impede our marketing efforts in those jurisdictions.

Our use of certain intellectual property rights is also subject to license agreements with third parties for certain patents, software and information technology systems and proprietary technologies. If these license agreements were terminated for any reason, it could result in the loss of our rights to this intellectual property, our operations may be materially adversely affected and we may be unable to commercialize certain offerings.

In addition, many of our branded pharmaceutical customers rely on patents to protect their products from generic competition. Because incentives exist in some countries, including the United States, for generic pharmaceutical companies to challenge these patents, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are under the ongoing threat of a challenge to their patents. If our customers’ patents were successfully challenged and as a result subjected to generic competition, the market for our customers’ products could be significantly impacted, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Our future results of operations are subject to fluctuations in the costs, availability, and suitability of the components of the products we manufacture, including active pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients, purchased components, and raw materials.

We depend on various active pharmaceutical ingredients, components, compounds, raw materials, and energy supplied primarily by others for our offerings. This includes, but is not limited to, gelatin, starch, iota carrageenan, petroleum-based products and resin. Also, our customers frequently provide their active pharmaceutical or biologic ingredient for formulation or incorporation in the finished product. It is possible that any of our customer supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural disasters, international supply disruptions caused by pandemics, geopolitical issues and other events, or could be terminated in the future.

For example, gelatin is a key component in our Oral Technologies segment. The supply of gelatin is obtained from a limited number of sources. In addition, much of the gelatin we use is bovine-derived. Past concerns of contamination from BSE have narrowed the number of possible sources of particular types of gelatin. If there were a future disruption in the supply of gelatin from any one or more key suppliers, we may not be able to obtain an alternative supply from our other suppliers. If future restrictions were to emerge on the use of bovine-derived gelatin due to concerns of contamination from BSE, any such restriction could hinder











our ability to timely supply our customers with products and the use of alternative non-bovine-derived gelatin could be subject to lengthy formulation, testing and regulatory approval.

Any sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate supplies could have an adverse effect on us. In addition, while we have processes intended to reduce volatility in component and material pricing, we may not be able to successfully manage price fluctuations and future price fluctuations or shortages may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Changes in market access or healthcare reimbursement for our customers’ products in the United States or internationally could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

The healthcare industry has changed significantly over time, and we expect the industry to continue to evolve. Some of these changes, such as ongoing healthcare reform, adverse changes in government or private funding of healthcare products and services, legislation or regulations governing the patient access to care and privacy, or the delivery, pricing or reimbursement approval of pharmaceuticals and healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause healthcare industry participants to change the amount of our offerings they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our offerings. Changes in the healthcare industry’s pricing, selling, inventory, distribution or supply policies or practices could also significantly reduce our revenue and results of operations. Particularly, volatility in individual product demand may result from changes in public or private payer reimbursement or coverage.

Fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations.

As a company with many international entities, certain revenues, costs, assets and liabilities, including a portion of our senior secured credit facilities and the 9.75% senior subordinated notes due 2017 (the "Senior Subordinated Notes"), are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in the exchange rates of these currencies or any other applicable currencies to the U.S. dollar will affect our revenues, earnings and cash flows and could result in unrealized and realized exchange losses despite any efforts we may undertake to manage or mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.

Tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We are a large multinational corporation with operations in the United States and international jurisdictions, including North America, South America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. As such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions. From time to time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. In addition, United States federal, state and local, as well as international tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.

Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.

We have net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. Utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to a substantial limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and comparable provisions of state, local and foreign tax laws due to changes in ownership of our company that may occur in the future. Under Section 382 of the Code and comparable provisions of state, local and foreign tax laws, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50% change by value in its equity ownership over a three year period, the corporation’s ability to carry forward its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to reduce its post-change income may be limited. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future changes in our stock ownership. As a result, if we generate taxable income in future years, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to reduce U.S. federal and state taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could result in increased future tax liability to us.

We are dependent on key personnel.

We depend on senior executive officers and other key personnel, including our technical personnel, to operate and grow our business and to develop new enhancements, offerings and technologies. The loss of any of these officers or other key personnel combined with a failure to attract and retain suitably skilled technical personnel could adversely affect our operations.

In addition to our executive officers, we rely on the top approximately 150 senior leaders to lead and direct the Company. Our senior leadership team (“SLT”) is comprised of vice presidents and directors who hold critical positions and possess specialized











talents and capabilities which give us a competitive advantage in the market. The members of the SLT hold positions such as general manager of manufacturing, general manager of analytical and development laboratories, vice president/general manager of business unit commercial development, director of operations, and vice president of quality and regulatory activities.

With respect to our technical talent, we have approximately 1,000 scientists and technicians whose areas of expertise and specialization cover subjects such as advanced delivery, drug and biologics formulation and manufacturing. Many of our sites and laboratories are located in competitive labor markets like Morrisville, North Carolina; Brussels, Belgium; Woodstock, Illinois; Madison, Wisconsin; and Schorndorf, Germany. Global and regional competitors and, in some cases, customers and suppliers, compete for the same skills and talent as we do.

Risks generally associated with our information systems could adversely affect our results of operations.

We rely on information systems in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data to:

•facilitate the manufacture and distribution of thousands of inventory items to and from our facilities;

•receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;

•manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers;

•manage the accurate accounting and payment for thousands of vendors; and

•schedule and operate our global network of development, manufacturing and packaging facilities.

Our results of operations could be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted, damaged by unforeseen events or fail for any extended period of time, including due to the actions of third parties.

We may in the future engage in acquisitions and other transactions that may complement or expand our business or divest of non-strategic businesses or assets. We may not be able to complete such transactions and such transactions, if executed, pose significant risks and could have a negative effect on our operations.

To the extent that we are not successful in completing divestitures, as such may be determined by future strategic plans and business performance, we may have to expend substantial amounts of cash, incur debt and continue to absorb loss-making or under-performing divisions. Any divestitures that we are unable to complete may involve a number of risks, including diversion of management’s attention, a negative impact on our customer relationships, costs associated with retaining the targeted divestiture, closing and disposing of the impacted business or transferring business to other facilities.

Our offerings and our customers’ products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties

From time to time, third parties have asserted intellectual property infringement claims against us and our customers and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against either us or our customers in the future. While we believe that our offerings do not infringe in any material respect upon proprietary rights of other parties and/or that meritorious defenses would exist with respect to any assertions to the contrary, there can be no assurance that we would not be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others. Patent applications in the United States and some foreign countries are generally not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued or published, and we may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our offerings or processes. If patents later issue on these applications, we may be found liable for subsequent infringement.











There has been substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries with respect to the manufacture, use and sale of products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights.

Any claims that our offerings or processes infringe these rights (including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of our customers), regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. We may not prevail in such proceedings given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If such proceedings result in an adverse outcome, we could, among other things, be required to:

•pay substantial damages (potentially treble damages in the United States);

•cease the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing offerings or processes;

•discontinue the use of the infringing technology;

•expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology;

•license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or may not be available at all; and

•lose the opportunity to license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments based upon successful protection and assertion of our intellectual property against others.

In addition, our customers’ products may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement and such claims could materially affect our business if their products cease to be manufactured and they have to discontinue the use of the infringing technology which we may provide.

Any of the foregoing could affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.



We are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which could increase our costs and restrict our operations in the future.

We are subject to labor and employment laws and regulations, which could increase our costs and restrict our operations in the future.

We employ approximately8,300employees worldwide, including approximately3,100employees in North America,3,600in Europe,1,000in South America and600in the Asia/Pacific region. Certain employees at one of our North American facilities are represented by a labor organization, and national works councils and/or labor organizations are active at all twelve of our European facilities consistent with labor environments/laws in European countries. Similar relationships with labor organizations or national works councils exist in our plants in Argentina, Brazil and Australia. Our management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory. However, further organizing activities or collective bargaining may increase our employment-related











costs and we may be subject to work stoppages and other labor disruptions. Moreover, as employers are subject to various employment-related claims, such as individual and class actions relating to alleged employment discrimination, wage-hour and labor standards issues, such actions, if brought against us and successful in whole or in part, may affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Certain of our pension plans are underfunded, and additional cash contributions we may be required to make will reduce the cash available for our business, such as the payment of our interest expense.

Certain of our employees in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan and Australia are participants in defined benefit pension plans which we sponsor. As ofJune 30, 2014, the underfunded amount of our pension plans on a worldwide basis was approximately$111.4 million, primarily related to our fiscal 2012 plans in the United Kingdom and Germany. In addition, we have an estimated obligation of approximately$39.6 million, as ofJune 30, 2014, related to our withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plans in which we participated, resulting in a total underfunded amount related to our pension plans of $151.0 million as ofJune 30, 2014. In general, the amount of future contributions to the underfunded plans will depend upon asset returns and a number of other factors and, as a result, the amount we may be required to contribute to such plans in the future may vary. Such cash contributions to the plans will reduce the cash available for our business to pursue strategic growth initiatives or the payment of interest expense on the notes or our other indebtedness.



Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness

Our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or in our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness.

We are highly leveraged.  As ofJune 30, 2014, we had (1)$1,722.5 million(dollar equivalent) of senior indebtedness; (2)$293.9 million(dollar equivalent) of Senior Subordinated Notes, (3) $348.7 millionof 7.875% Senior Notes due 2018 (the "Senior Notes") and (4)$274.3 millionof senior unsecured term loan. In addition, we had an additional$182.7 millionof unutilized capacity and$17.3 millionof outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility.

OnAugust 5, 2014, the Company completed an initial public offering of 42.5 million shares of its common stock for an initial price of $20.50 per share for total proceeds, before underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses, of approximately $871.3 million and proceeds net of underwriters discount and commission and other offering expenses of approximately $822.7 million.  The proceeds raised were used to redeem the outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes, redeem the outstanding Senior Notes, and pay a termination fee of $29.8 million to affiliates of Blackstone and certain other existing owners.  The remaining proceeds were used to repay portions of amounts outstanding under our unsecured term loan facility.

Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences for us, including:

•increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;

•exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, are at variable rates of interest;

•exposing us to the risk of fluctuations in exchange rates because certain of our borrowings, including certain of our senior secured term loan facilities and the Senior Subordinated Notes, are denominated in euros;

•making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, including the notes, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under the indenture governing the notes and the agreements governing such other indebtedness;

•restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;

•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and

•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting.

Our total interest expense, net was$163.1 million,$203.2 millionand$183.2 millionfor fiscal years2014,2013and2012, respectively. After taking into consideration our ratio of fixed-to-floating rate debt, a 100 basis point increase in such rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $2.4 million.













Despite our high indebtedness level, we and our subsidiaries will still be able to incur significant additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial.



Our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.

The agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness and our new senior secured credit facilities contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit the ability of our subsidiary, Catalent Pharma Solutions, Inc., and its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things:

•incur additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

•pay certain dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock or make other restricted payments;

•place limitations on distributions from restricted subsidiaries;

•issue or sell capital stock of restricted subsidiaries;

•guarantee certain indebtedness;

•make certain investments;

•sell or exchange assets;

•enter into transactions with affiliates;

•create certain liens; and

•consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of their assets and the assets of their subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of these agreements, including as a result of cross default provisions, and, in the case of our revolving credit facility, permit the lenders to cease making loans to us.

We may utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates on our variable rate indebtedness and we will be exposed to risks related to counterparty credit worthiness or non-performance of these instruments.

We may enter into pay-fixed interest rate swaps to limit our exposure to changes in variable interest rates. Such instruments may result in economic losses should exchange rates decline to a point lower than our fixed rate commitments. We will be exposed to credit-related losses which could impact the results of operations in the event of fluctuations in the fair value of the interest rate swaps due to a change in the credit worthiness or non-performance by the counterparties to the interest rate swaps.

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock

Our stock price may change significantly, and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid or at all, and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result.

The trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile. The stock market recently has experienced extreme volatility. This volatility often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. The trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected due to a number of factors such as those listed in “Risks Related











to Our Business and Our Industry” and the following:





•results of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;

These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our common stock is low.

In the past, following periods of market volatility, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation. If we were involved in securities litigation, it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of executive management from our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation.

Because we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.

We intend to retain future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion and debt repayment and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. The declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends on shares of common stock will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors. Our board of directors may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is limited by covenants of our existing and outstanding indebtedness and may be limited by covenants of any future indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.

If securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock or our sector, our stock price and trading volume could decline.

The trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock or our industry, or the stock of any of our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of the Company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.

Future sales, or the perception of future sales of common stock, by us or our existing stockholders could cause the market price for our common stock to decline.











The sale of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.

As of September 1, 2014, 74,821,337 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 64% of our total outstanding shares of common stock, will be “restricted securities” within the meaning of Rule 144 of the Securities Act (“Rule 144”) and subject to certain restrictions on resale. Restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they are registered under the Securities Act or are sold pursuant to an exemption from registration such as Rule 144.

In connection with our initial public offering, we, our directors and executive officers, and holders of substantially all of our common stock immediately prior to our initial public offering agreed with the underwriters of the initial public offering, subject to certain exceptions, not to dispose of or hedge any of our or their common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock for 180 days following the date of the initial public offering prospectus, except with the prior written consent of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC.

In addition, 2,801,761 shares of common stock will be eligible for sale upon exercise of vested options. We have filed a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register all shares of common stock subject to outstanding stock options and the shares of common stock subject to issuance under the 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan. The Form S-8 registration statement automatically became effective upon filing. The initial registration statement on Form S-8 covered 13,192,080 shares of common stock. These shares can be sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to restrictions under the securities laws applicable to resales by affiliates.

Upon the expiration of the lock-up agreements described above, the remaining restricted shares will be eligible for resale, which would be subject to volume, manner of sale and other limitations under Rule 144. In addition, pursuant to a registration rights agreement, certain holders of restricted shares, subject to certain conditions, to require us to register the sale of their shares of our common stock under the Securities Act. By exercising their registration rights and selling a large number of shares, such holders could cause the prevailing market price of our common stock to decline. The shares covered by registration rights represent approximately 63% of our outstanding common stock. Registration of any of these outstanding shares of common stock would result in such shares becoming freely tradable without compliance with Rule 144 upon effectiveness of the registration statement.

As restrictions on resale end or if these stockholders exercise their registration rights, the market price of our shares of common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our shares of common stock or other securities. In the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of then-outstanding shares of our common stock. Any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in dilution to you.

Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control.

Certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders.

These provisions provide for, among other things:

•a classified board of directors with staggered three-year

•the ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock;

•advance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at our annual meetings;

•certain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings;

•the removal of directors only for cause and only upon the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the shares of common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors if Blackstone and its affiliates hold less than 40% of our outstanding shares of common stock; and

•that certain provisions may be amended only by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the shares of common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors if Blackstone and its affiliates cease to hold less than 40% of our outstanding shares of common stock.











These anti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third-party’s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders. As a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares.

Affiliates of Blackstone control us and their interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future.

Affiliates of Blackstone beneficially own approximately55%of our common stock. As a result, investment funds associated with or designated by affiliates of Blackstone have the ability to elect all of the members of our board of directors and thereby control our policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of our common stock or other securities, the payment of dividends, if any, on our common stock, the incurrence or modification of debt by us, amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and the entering into of extraordinary transactions, and their interests may not in all cases be aligned with your interests. In addition, Blackstone may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to you. For example, Blackstone could cause us to make acquisitions that increase our indebtedness or cause us to sell revenue-generating assets. Additionally, in certain circumstances, acquisitions of debt at a discount by purchasers that are related to a debtor can give rise to cancellation of indebtedness income to such debtor for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Blackstone is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. For example, Blackstone has made investments in Biomet, Inc., Emcure Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Apria Healthcare Group Inc., Nycomed Holding A/S, DJO Global LLC, Independent Clinical Services Ltd, Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC, Stiefel Laboratories, Inc., Team Health Holdings, Inc. and Vanguard Health Systems, Inc.

We are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the rules of the New York Stock Exchange and the rules of the SEC. As a result, we qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that would otherwise provide protection to stockholders of other companies.

Blackstone controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of the New York Stock Exchange. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including:

•the requirement that a majority of our board of directors consist of “independent directors” as defined under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange;

•the requirement that our director nominees be selected, or recommended for our board of directors’ selection by a nominating/governance committee comprised solely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the nominations process;

•the requirement that the compensation of our executive officers be determined, or recommended to our board of directors for determination, by a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors; and

•the requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating/corporate governance and compensation committees.

As a result, we are not currently required to have a majority of independent directors, our nominating/corporate governance committee, and compensation committee are not currently required to consist entirely of independent directors and such committees are not currently subject to annual performance evaluations. Accordingly, you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange.











In addition, on June 20, 2012, the SEC passed final rules implementing provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 pertaining to compensation committee independence and the role and disclosure of compensation consultants and other advisers to the compensation committee. The SEC’s rules direct each of the national securities exchanges (including the New York Stock Exchange on which we intend to list our common stock) to develop listing standards requiring, among other things, that:

•compensation committees be composed of fully independent directors, as determined pursuant to new independence requirements;

•compensation committees be explicitly charged with hiring and overseeing compensation consultants, legal counsel and other committee advisors; and

•compensation committees be required to consider, when engaging compensation consultants, legal counsel or other advisors, certain independence factors, including factors that examine the relationship between the consultant or advisor’s employer and us.

As a “controlled company,” we are not subject to these compensation committee independence requirements.
