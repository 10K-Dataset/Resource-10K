Item 1A. Risk Factors

This report contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of United States (U.S.) federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements are all statements other than statements of historical facts, such as statements regarding projected ore grades and milling rates, projected production and sales volumes, projected unit net cash costs, projected operating cash flows, projected capital expenditures, exploration efforts and results, the impact of deferred intercompany profits on earnings, liquidity, other financial commitments and tax rates, the impact of copper, gold molybdenum and cobalt price changes, availability of power, water, labor and equipment, reclamation and closure costs and plans, environmental liabilities and expenditures, litigation contingencies and results, dividend payments, potential prepayments of debt, reserve estimates, and anticipated political, economic and social conditions in our areas of operations. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, projected or assumed in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements include the following.



Financial risks



Extended declines in the market prices of copper, gold and/or molybdenum could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows and, if sustained, could adversely affect our ability to repay debt. Fluctuations in the market prices of copper, gold or molybdenum can cause significant volatility in our financial performance and adversely affect the trading prices of our debt and equity securities.



Our financial results vary as a result of fluctuations in metal market prices, including copper, gold and molybdenum (for further information about the market prices of these commodities, refer to discussion below and in Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”). An extended decline in the market prices of these commodities could adversely affect our financial results, affect our ability to repay our debt and meet our other fixed obligations, and depress the trading prices of our common stock and of our publicly traded debt securities.



Additionally, if market prices for the metals we produce decline for a sustained period of time, we may have to revise our operating plans, including curtailing production, reducing operating costs and capital expenditures and discontinuing certain exploration and development programs. We may be unable to decrease our costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues, and may incur losses.



Substantially all of our copper concentrate and cathode sales contracts provide final copper pricing in a specified future month (generally one to four months from the shipment date) based primarily on quoted London Metal Exchange (LME) monthly average spot copper prices. Accordingly, in times of rising copper prices, our revenues benefit from adjustments to the final pricing of provisionally priced sales pursuant to contracts entered into in prior periods; in times of falling copper prices, the opposite occurs.



Copper prices have fluctuated historically, with LME spot copper prices ranging from$1.38to$4.60per pound during the three years endedDecember 31, 2011. Copper prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including:



•The strength of the U.S. economy and the economies of other industrialized and developing nations, including China, which has become the largest consumer of refined copper in the world;



•Available supplies of copper from mine production and inventories;



•Sales by holders and producers of copper;



•Demand for industrial products containing copper;



•Investment activity, including speculation, in copper as a commodity;



•The availability and cost of substitute materials; and



•Currency exchange fluctuations, including the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar.













Gold prices have also fluctuated historically, with the London PM gold price ranging from $810 to$1,895per ounce during the three years ended December 31, 2011. Gold prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including:



•The strength of the U.S. economy and the economies of other industrialized and developing nations, including China and India;



•Global or regional political or economic crises;



•The relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar and other currencies;



•Expectations with respect to the rate of inflation;



•Interest rates;



•Purchases and sales of gold by governments, central banks and other holders;



•Demand for jewelry containing gold; and



•Investment activity, including speculation, in gold as a commodity.



Molybdenum prices also fluctuate, with theMetals WeekMolybdenum Dealer Oxide weekly average price ranging from $7.83 to $18.60 per pound during the three years ended December 31, 2011. Molybdenum prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including:



•The worldwide balance of molybdenum demand and supply;



•Rates of global economic growth, especially construction and infrastructure activity that requires significant amounts of steel;



•The volume of molybdenum produced as a by-product of copper production;



•Inventory levels;



•Currency exchange fluctuations, including the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar; and



•Production costs of U.S. and foreign competitors.



Under U.S. federal and state laws that require closure and reclamation plans for our mines, we generally are required to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement those plans if we are unable to do so. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state agencies may seek financial assurance for investigation and remediation actions under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) or equivalent state regulations.The failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse affect on us.



We are required by U.S. federal and state laws to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans if we are unable to do so. These laws are complex and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The laws govern the determination of the scope and cost of the closure and reclamation obligations and the amount and forms of financial assurance.



EPA and state agencies may seek financial assurance for investigation and remediation actions under CERCLA or equivalent state regulations. In July 2009, EPA published a Priority Notice of Action identifying classes of facilities within the hardrock mining industry for which the agency will develop financial responsibility requirements concerning the degree and duration of risk associated with the production, transportation, treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous substances. In EPA's semi-annual regulatory agenda published on February 13, 2012, EPA indicated that it intends to propose regulations regarding hardrock mining financial responsibility in April 2013. It is uncertain how the new requirements, if promulgated, will affect the amount and form of our existing and future financial assurance obligations.













The amount of financial assurance we are required to provide will vary with changes in laws, regulations and reclamation and closure requirements and cost estimates. As of

December 31, 2011

, our financial assurance obligations associated with closure and reclamation costs in New Mexico, Arizona and Colorado totaled

$899 million

, of which

$565 million

was in the form of parent company guarantees and financial capability demonstrations. Our ability to continue to provide financial assurance in the form of parent guarantees and financial capability demonstrations depends on our ability to meet financial tests. Certain of the ratios in these tests are significantly more rigorous for companies that do not have an investment grade rating from a state-approved ratings service. We are currently rated investment grade by Standard & Poor's Rating Services (S&P), Fitch Ratings and Moody's Investors Service (Moody's). If we fail to maintain our investment grade rating, we would be subject to these more rigorous tests, in which case the regulatory agencies may require us to provide alternative forms of financial assurance, such as letters of credit, surety bonds or collateral. Depending on our financial condition and market conditions, these other forms of financial assurance may be difficult or costly to provide. Issuance of letters of credit under our credit facilities would reduce our available liquidity. Failure to provide the required financial assurance could result in the closure of mines. As of

December 31, 2011

, we had limited financial assurance obligations associated with CERCLA-related remediation obligations, although EPA and certain states are currently considering increasing the use of financial assurance requirements for such obligations.



For additional information, see the environmental risk factor “Mine closure regulations impose substantial costs on our operations.”



In July 2011, the Chilean senate passed legislation regulating mine closure, which establishes new requirements for closure plans and becomes effective in November 2012. Our Chilean operations will be required to update closure plans and provide financial assurance for these obligations. We cannot predict at this time the costs of these closure plans or the levels or forms of financial assurance that may be required.



In December 2010, the President of Indonesia issued a regulation regarding mine reclamation and closure, which requires a company to provide a mine closure guarantee in the form of a time deposit placed in a state-owned bank in Indonesia. In accordance with its Contract of Work (COW), PT Freeport Indonesia is working with the Department of Energy and Mineral Resources to review these requirements, including discussions of other options for the mine closure guarantee. In December 2009, PT Freeport Indonesia submitted its revised mine closure plan to the Department of Energy and Minerals Resources for review and has addressed comments received during the course of this review process.



Movements in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively affect our operating results.



The functional currency for most of our operations is the U.S. dollar. All of our revenues and a significant portion of our costs are denominated in U.S. dollars; however, some costs and certain asset and liability accounts are denominated in local currencies, including the Indonesian rupiah, Australian dollar, Chilean peso, Peruvian nuevo sol, euro and South African rand. Generally, our results are positively affected when the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to those foreign currencies and adversely affected when the U.S. dollar weakens in relation to those foreign currencies. Refer to Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for a summary of the estimated impact of changes in foreign currency rates on our annual operating costs.



From time to time, we may implement currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange. However, our hedging strategies may not be successful, and any of our unhedged foreign exchange payments will continue to be subject to market fluctuations.



International risks



Our international operations are subject to political, social and geographic risks of doing business in foreign countries.



We are a global mining company with substantial assets located outside of the U.S. We conduct international mining operations in Indonesia, Peru, Chile and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Accordingly, in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in foreign countries, our business may be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties in each of these countries. Such risks include:



•Renegotiation, cancellation or forced modification of existing contracts,



•Expropriation or nationalization of property,













•Changes in a foreign country's laws, regulations and policies, including those relating to labor, taxation, royalties, divestment, imports, exports, trade regulations, currency and environmental matters,



•Political instability, bribery, extortion, corruption, civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla activities, insurrection and terrorism,



•Foreign exchange controls, and



•The risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel or having to enforce the judgment of a foreign court or arbitration panel against a sovereign nation within its own territory.



Our insurance does not cover most losses caused by the above described risks. Accordingly, our exploration, development and production activities outside of the U.S. could be substantially affected by factors beyond our control, some of which could materially and adversely affect our financial position or results of operations.



In October 2010, PT Freeport Indonesia received an assessment from the Indonesian tax authorities for additional taxes of $106 million and interest of $52 million related to various audit exceptions for 2005. In November 2011, PT Freeport Indonesia received an assessment from the Indonesian tax authorities for additional taxes of $22 million and interest of $10 million related to various audit exceptions for 2006. PT Freeport Indonesia has paid $109 million for these disputed tax assessments and filed objections to these assessments because it believes it has properly paid all taxes. PT Freeport Indonesia is working with the Indonesian tax authorities to resolve these matters and expects to receive additional assessments from the Indonesian tax authorities for their audit of its 2007 tax return.



In December 2009, PT Freeport Indonesia was notified by the Large Taxpayer's Office of the Government of Indonesia of its view that PT Freeport Indonesia is obligated to pay value added taxes on certain goods imported after the year 2000. The amount of such taxes and related penalties under this view would be significant. PT Freeport Indonesia believes that, pursuant to the terms of its COW, it is only required to pay value added taxes on these types of goods imported after December 30, 2009. PT Freeport Indonesia has not received a formal assessment and is working with the applicable government authorities to resolve this matter.



SUNAT, the Peruvian national tax authority, has assessed mining royalties on materials processed by the Cerro Verde concentrator which commenced operations in late 2006. These assessments cover the period October 2006 to December 2007 and the years 2008 and 2009. SUNAT has issued rulings denying Cerro Verde's protest of the assessments. Cerro Verde has appealed these decisions and currently has three cases pending before the Peruvian Tax Tribunal. Cerro Verde is challenging these royalties because it believes its stability agreement provides an exemption for all minerals extracted from its mining concession, irrespective of the method used for processing those minerals. Although we believe our interpretation of the stability agreement is correct, if Cerro Verde is ultimately found responsible for these assessments, it will also be liable for interest, which accrues at rates that range from approximately 7 to 18 percent based on the year accrued and the currency in which the amounts would be payable. AtDecember 31, 2011, the aggregate amount of the assessments, including interest and penalties, totaled $190 million. SUNAT may continue to assess mining royalties annually until this matter is resolved by the Peruvian Tax Tribunal.



Because our Grasberg minerals district is our most significant operating asset, our business may continue to be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties and security risks in Indonesia.



Indonesia has faced political and social uncertainties, including separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces. In particular, several separatist groups are opposing Indonesian rule over the province of Papua, where our Grasberg minerals district is located, and have sought political independence for the province. In response, Indonesia enacted regional autonomy laws, which became effective January 1, 2001. The manner in which those laws are being implemented and the degree of political and economic autonomy that they may bring to individual provinces, including Papua, are uncertain and are ongoing issues in Indonesian politics. In Papua, there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the Indonesian military. Social, economic and political instability in Papua could materially and adversely affect us if it results in damage to our property or interruption of our activities.



Maintaining a good working relationship with the Indonesian government is important to us because our mining operations there are among Indonesia's most significant business enterprises and are conducted pursuant to a COW with the Indonesian government. Partially because of their significance to Indonesia's economy, the











environmentally sensitive area in which they are located, and the number of people employed, our operations are occasionally the subject of criticism in the Indonesian press and in political debates, and have been the target of protests and occasional violence.



Between July 2009 and February 2012, there were 32 shooting incidents in and around the Grasberg minerals district, including along the road leading to our mining and milling operations, which resulted in 15 fatalities and 56 injuries. Victims included PT Freeport Indonesia employees, contractors, members of law enforcement and civilians. The identity of the perpetrators is unknown as is the motivation for the shootings. The investigation of these matters is continuing. We have taken precautionary measures, including using secured convoys on the road. The Indonesian government has responded with additional security forces and expressed a commitment to protect the safety of the community and our operations. Prolonged limitations on access to the road could adversely affect operations at the mine. The safety of our workforce is a critical concern, and PT Freeport Indonesia is working cooperatively with the Government of Indonesia to address security issues.



During 2011, PT Freeport Indonesia was adversely affected by labor disruptions, including an eight-day work stoppage in July 2011 and an approximate three-month strike that concluded in December 2011. The strike involved civil unrest, transportation blockades, sabotage of important operating facilities and violence. Although a new labor agreement was reached in mid-December 2011, we are experiencing work interruptions in connection with our efforts to resume normal operations at PT Freeport Indonesia. PT Freeport Indonesia is complying with the terms of the new labor agreement with its union. Certain of the returning workers have engaged in acts of violence and intimidation against workers and supervisory personnel who did not participate in the strike. On February 23, 2012, the union indicated that it will engage in a work stoppage and we temporarily suspended operations to protect our employees and assets following the incidents of intimidation and threats within the workforce. We are working with union officials and government authorities to resolve the ongoing issues. Refer to Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for further discussion.



Large numbers of illegal miners have continued to operate along the river used to transport the tailings from the mill to the lowlands in PT Freeport Indonesia's government-approved tailings management area. The illegal miners have periodically clashed with police who have attempted to move them away from our facilities. In 2006, the illegal miners temporarily blocked the road leading to the Grasberg mine and mill in protest, and PT Freeport Indonesia temporarily suspended mining and milling operations as a precautionary measure.



We cannot predict whether additional incidents will occur that could disrupt or suspend our Indonesian operations.  If additional violence or other disruptive incidents occur, it could adversely affect our business and profitability in ways that we cannot predict at this time.



We do not expect to mine all of our ore reserves in Indonesia before the initial term of our COW expires.



PT Freeport Indonesia is entitled to mine in Indonesia under its COW with the Government of Indonesia. The initial term of the current COW expires in 2021, but can be extended for two 10-year periods subject to Indonesian government approval, which pursuant to the COW cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably. Our proven and probable ore reserves in Indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041 and our current mine plan has been developed, and our operations are based on the assumption that we will receive the two 10-year extensions. As a result, we will not mine all of these ore reserves during the initial term of the current COW, and there can be no assurance that the Indonesian government will approve the extensions. Prior to the end of 2021, we expect to mine 31 percent of aggregate proven and probable recoverable ore at December 31, 2011, representing 37 percent of PT Freeport Indonesia's share of recoverable copper reserves and 49 percent of its share of recoverable gold reserves.



In 2009, Indonesia enacted a new mining law, which will operate under a licensing system as opposed to the contract of work system that applies to PT Freeport Indonesia. In 2011 and 2010, the Government of Indonesia promulgated regulations under the 2009 mining law and certain provisions address existing contracts of work.  The laws and regulations provide that contracts of work will continue to be honored until their expiration. However, the regulations attempt to apply certain provisions of the new law to existing contracts and may seek to apply the licensing system to any extension periods of contracts of work, even though our COW provides for two 10-year extension periods subject to Indonesian government approval, which pursuant to the COW cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably. In February 2012, a new regulation was adopted that would require mining companies in Indonesia to process all minerals domestically and possibly ban export of concentrates and other unrefined minerals. There are specific provisions included in PT Freeport Indonesia's existing COW that define its rights to











export product and the obligation to develop domestic smelting capacity if commercially feasible, or to contract with other domestic smelters on a market basis. In connection with the obligations under its COW, in 1995, PT Freeport Indonesia constructed the only copper smelter and refinery in Indonesia, which is owned and operated by PT Smelting.



Our COWs in Indonesia are subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations, and if a dispute arises, we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel.



PT Freeport Indonesia's COW and other COWs in which we have an interest were entered into under Indonesia's 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law, which provides guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization. Our COWs can be terminated by the Government of Indonesia if we do not satisfy our contractual obligations, which include the payment of royalties and taxes to the government and the satisfaction of certain mining, environmental, safety and health requirements.



Certain forestry laws and designations as well as prevailing environmental laws and regulations may conflict with or overlap with the mining rights established under our COW. Although our COW grants to PT Freeport Indonesia the unencumbered right to operate in accordance with the COW, certain government agencies could seek to impose additional restrictions on PT Freeport Indonesia that could affect exploration and operating requirements.



At times, certain government officials and others in Indonesia have questioned the validity of contracts entered into by the Government of Indonesia prior to May 1998 (i.e.,during the Suharto regime, which lasted over 30 years), including PT Freeport Indonesia's COW, which was signed in December 1991. We cannot provide assurance that the validity of, or our compliance with, the COWs will not be challenged for political or other reasons. PT Freeport Indonesia's COW and our other COWs require that disputes with the Indonesian government be submitted to international arbitration. Accordingly, if a dispute arises under the COWs, we face the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel, and if we prevail in such a dispute, we will face the additional risk of having to enforce the judgment of a foreign court or arbitration panel against Indonesia within its own territory.



Indonesian government officials have periodically undertaken reviews regarding our compliance with Indonesian environmental laws and regulations and the terms of the COWs. In January 2012, the President of Indonesia issued a decree calling for the creation of a team to evaluate contracts of work for adjustment to the 2009 Mining Law, and accordingly, to take steps to assess and negotiate size of work areas, government revenues, and domestic processing of minerals. The team includes 14 cabinet-level members representing 13 formal government institutions led by the Coordinating Minister of Economy and the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, with the Director General of Mineral and Coal as the Secretary. The team's assignment runs through December 2013 and the group is expected to provide progress reports to the President every six months. We intend to continue to work cooperatively with the Government of Indonesia to complete this review and to seek extension of the COW beyond 2021, as provided under the terms of the COW. The COW can only be modified by mutual agreement between PT Freeport Indonesia and the Government of Indonesia.



Any suspension of required activities under our COWs requires the consent of the Indonesian government.



Our COWs permit us to suspend certain contractually required activities, including exploration, for a period of one year by making a written request to the Indonesian government. These requests are subject to the approval of the Indonesian government and are renewable annually. If we do not request a suspension or are denied a suspension, then we are required to continue our activities under the COW or potentially be declared in default. Moreover, if a suspension continues for more than one year for reasons other than force majeure and the Indonesian government has not approved such continuation, then the government would be entitled to declare a default under the COW.



We previously suspended our field exploration activities outside of the Block A area of PT Freeport Indonesia's COW because of safety and security issues and regulatory uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest areas and an Indonesian Forestry law enacted in 1999 prohibiting open-pit mining in forest preservation areas. In 2001, we requested and received from the Government of Indonesia, formal temporary suspensions of our obligations under the COWs in all areas outside of Block A. Recent Indonesian legislation permits open-pit mining in the Block B area of PT Freeport Indonesia's COW, subject to certain requirements. Following an assessment of these requirements and a review of security issues, in 2007 we resumed exploration activities in certain prospective COW areas outside of Block A.













The Tenke Fungurume minerals district is located in the Katanga province of the DRC, and may be adversely affected by political, economic and social instability in the DRC.





In November 2011, the DRC held a general presidential election. On December 16, 2011, incumbent President Joseph Kabila was declared the winner of that election by the DRC Supreme Court. There has been widespread international and local criticism of the election and episodes of protests, some of which were accompanied by acts of violence.



In July 2009, TFM was advised that the Minister of Justice in the DRC authorized an inquiry regarding the alleged misappropriation of public funds in connection with securing labor and immigration authorizations and the payment of associated fees for the Tenke Fungurume project. Several government officials and three TFM employees were arrested. In October 2009, the three TFM employees were tried and acquitted. One government official, the head of immigration in the Katanga province, was sentenced to five years imprisonment on charges of embezzlement. The office of the Attorney General of the DRC filed a notice of appeal of the judgment, and the matter is pending at the Appellate Court.



In July 2009, TFM entered into a settlement agreement with DRC tax authorities in connection with an administrative audit regarding the payment of fees for work permits and visas for its foreign workers and subcontractors, including short-term workers. Pursuant to the agreement, which covers the period from January 2007 to the date of the settlement, TFM paid approximately $16 million in fees and penalties. The procedures associated with obtaining labor and immigration authorizations for short-term workers on a timely basis are not clearly established in the DRC, and TFM continues to work proactively and cooperatively with the government authorities to establish approved procedures for doing so consistent with its mining convention and local law. In connection with this matter, we notified the U.S. government enforcement authorities about our internal investigation of the immigration work permit and visa matter and the associated criminal case. We have received and responded to requests from U.S. government authorities related to the matter and to other requests for information about our compliance program.



Political, economic and social risks that are generally outside of our control and could adversely affect our business include:



•Political risks associated with the establishment and re-election of the present government;



•Cancellation or renegotiation of mining contracts by the government;



•Legal and regulatory uncertainties, governmental corruption and bribery;



•Royalty and tax increases or claims by governmental entities, including retroactive claims;



•Security risks due to the remote location in the southern DRC and violence in the northeastern provinces of the DRC;













•Risk of loss of property due to expropriation or nationalization of property; and



•Risk of loss due to civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla activities, insurrection and terrorism.



Accordingly, the Tenke Fungurume minerals district and its future development projects may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control, any of which could adversely affect our operating results, interrupt our operations or result in a loss of all or part of our investment in the DRC.



Terrorist attacks and violence near our operations and throughout the world and the potential for additional future terrorist acts and violence have created economic and political uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our business.



In July 2009, two suicide bombers set off explosions inside of the JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels in Jakarta, Indonesia, that killed nine people and injured 53 others. Two of our Indonesian-based executives were injured in the incident.



In July 2009, a small group of individuals created a disturbance on the road leading to our mining and milling operations at our Grasberg minerals district and vandalized vehicles and small buildings. There were no injuries. For more information about a series of shooting incidents near our Grasberg minerals district, refer to the risk factor “Because our Grasberg minerals district is our most significant operating asset, our business may continue to be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties in Indonesia.”



In August 2002, three people were killed and 11 others were wounded in an ambush by a group of unidentified assailants on the road near Tembagapura, the mining town where the majority of PT Freeport Indonesia's personnel reside. The assailants shot at several vehicles transporting international contract teachers from our school in Tembagapura, their family members and other contractors to PT Freeport Indonesia. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigated the incident, which resulted in the U.S. indictment of an alleged operational commander of the Free Papua Movement/National Freedom Force. In January 2006, Indonesian police, accompanied by FBI agents, arrested the alleged operational commander and 11 other Papuans. In November 2006, verdicts and sentencing were announced for seven of those accused in the August 2002 shooting, including a life sentence for the confessed leader of the attack.



In October 2002, a bombing killed 202 people in the Indonesian province of Bali, which is 1,500 miles west of our mining and milling operations. Indonesian authorities arrested 35 people in connection with this bombing and 29 of those arrested have been tried and convicted. In August 2003, 12 people were killed and over 100 were injured by a car bomb detonated outside of the JW Marriott Hotel in Jakarta, Indonesia. In September 2004, 11 people were killed and over 200 injured by a car bomb detonated in front of the Australian embassy in Jakarta. In October 2005, three suicide bombers killed 19 people and wounded over 100 in Bali. The same international terrorist organizations are suspected in each of these incidents. In November 2005, Indonesian police raided a house in East Java that resulted in the death of other accused terrorists linked to the bombings discussed above. Our mining and milling operations were not interrupted by these incidents, but PT Freeport Indonesia's corporate office in Jakarta had to relocate for several months following the bombing in front of the Australian embassy. In addition to the Bali, JW Marriott Hotel and Australian embassy bombings, there have been anti-American demonstrations in certain sections of Indonesia reportedly led by radical Islamic activists.



No assurance can be given that additional terrorist incidents and acts of violence will not occur. If there were to be additional terrorist incidents or acts of violence, particularly at or near our operations, there could be no assurance that the occurrence of such events would not have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.



Operational risks



Our business is subject to operational risks that could adversely affect our business.



Mines by their nature are subject to many operational risks, some of which are outside of our control. These operational risks, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and cash flows, include the following:



•Earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters;













•The occurrence of unusual weather or operating conditions and other force majeure events;



•The failure of equipment or processes to operate in accordance with specifications, design or expectations;



•Accidents;



•Wall failures and rock slides in our open-pit mines, and structural collapses in our underground mines;



•Problems associated with the construction and management of large impoundments containing tailings or other viscous or semi-solid materials, some of which also contain mineral and chemical contaminants, such as structural failures or leakages;



•Interruption of energy supply;



•Lower than expected ore grades or recovery rates;



•Metallurgical and other processing problems;



•Unanticipated ground and water conditions;



•Adverse claims to water rights, adverse outcomes of pending water adjudications and shortages of water to which we have rights;



•Adjacent land ownership or usage that results in constraints on current or future mine operations;



•Delays in the receipt of or failure to receive necessary government authorizations, approvals or permits;



•Delays in transportation and disruptions of supply routes;



•The inability to obtain satisfactory insurance coverage.



The failure to adequately manage these risks could result in significant personal injury, loss of life, property damage and damage to the environment, both in and around our areas of operations, as well as damage to production facilities and delays in or curtailments of production.



Labor unrest and activism could disrupt our operations and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.



As further described in Items 1 and 2. “Business and Properties,” we are party to labor agreements with various unions that represent employees at our operations. Labor agreements are negotiated on a periodic basis, and the risk exists that labor agreements may not be renewed on reasonably satisfactory terms to us or at all. We cannot predict what issues may be raised by the collective bargaining units representing our employees and, if raised, whether negotiations concerning those issues will be concluded successfully. Our production and sales volumes could be significantly reduced and our business, financial condition and results of operations adversely affected by significant reductions in productivity or protracted work stoppages at one or more of our operations. Additionally, if we enter into a new labor agreement with any union that significantly increases our labor costs relative to our competitors, our ability to compete may be materially and adversely affected.



During 2011, PT Freeport Indonesia was adversely affected by labor disruptions, including an eight-day work stoppage in July 2011 and an approximate three-month strike that concluded in December 2011. The strike involved civil unrest, transportation blockades, sabotage of important operating facilities and violence. In mid-December 2011, the financial terms of a new two-year labor agreement for PT Freeport Indonesia were reached and the parties agreed that future wage negotiations would be based on living costs and the competitiveness of wages within Indonesia. Although a new labor agreement has been reached, we are experiencing work interruptions in connection with our efforts to resume normal operations at PT Freeport Indonesia. PT Freeport Indonesia is complying with the terms of the new labor agreement with its union. Certain of the returning workers have engaged in acts of violence and intimidation against workers and supervisory personnel who did not participate in the strike. On February 23, 2012, the union indicated that it will engage in a work stoppage and we temporarily











suspended operations to protect our employees and assets following the incidents of intimidation and threats within the workforce. We are working with union officials and government authorities to resolve the ongoing issues. Refer to Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for further discussion.



In fourth-quarter 2011, there was an approximate two-month labor strike at Cerro Verde during the negotiation of a new labor agreement. The strike did not have a significant impact on production, and a new three-year agreement with the union was reached in late December 2011.



If we do not successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements with our union workers, we may incur prolonged strikes and other work stoppages at our mining operations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.



Our mining production depends on the availability of sufficient water supplies.



Our operations require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. Our operations in North and South America are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant. Continuous production at our mines depends on our ability to maintain our water rights and claims.



At our North America operations, our water rights give us only the right to use public waters for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location. In Arizona, we are a participant in two active general stream adjudications in which, for over 30 years, the state of Arizona has been attempting to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for two of the state's largest river systems that affect four of our operating mines (Morenci, Safford, Sierrita and Miami). The legal precedent set in these proceedings may also affect our Bagdad mine. Groundwater has historically been treated separately from surface water under Arizona law, which has generally allowed land owners to pump at will,  subject to the doctrine of reasonable use. However, court decisions in recent years have concluded that if groundwater pumping produces or affects surface water, then such pumping requires surface water rights and is subject to the general stream adjudications. The effort to define the boundaries between groundwater and surface water is currently the focus of one of those adjudications.



In Colorado, our surface water and groundwater rights are subject to adjudication and we are involved in legal proceedings to resolve disputes regarding priority of administration of rights, including priority of some of our rights for the Climax molybdenum mine. In New Mexico, our surface water and groundwater rights are fully licensed or have been fully adjudicated.



Water for our Cerro Verde mining operation comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs on the Rio Chili watershed that collect water primarily from seasonal precipitation. Due to occasional drought conditions and the possibility that climate change will reduce precipitation levels, temporary supply shortages are possible that could affect our current and planned Cerro Verde operations. Cerro Verde has been conducting water studies to assess opportunities for additional supplies to support current operations and potential future expansion projects. In 2011, Cerro Verde reached an agreement with the Regional Government of Arequipa, the National Government, Servicio de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado de Arequipa S.A. (SEDAPAR) and other local institutions to allow Cerro Verde to finance the engineering and construction of a wastewater treatment plant, should it proceed with plans for a large-scale concentrator expansion. Once Cerro Verde obtains a license for the treated water, it would be used to supplement its existing water supplies to support the potential concentrator expansion.



Water for our El Abra mining operation comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the Salar de Ascotán aquifer. In 2010, El Abra obtained regulatory approval, subject to certain conditions, for the continued pumping of groundwater from the Salar de Ascotán aquifer for its sulfide processing plant, which began operations in 2011. We believe that El Abra has sufficient water rights to support current operations, however, a change to the sulfide ore project, such as increased production or mill processing, would require additional water beyond our sulfide groundwater pumping, which is permitted through 2021. El Abra is also conducting studies to assess the feasibility of constructing a desalination plant near the Pacific Ocean to treat seawater for possible increased sulfide ore production or mill processing.



Water for our Candelaria and Ojos del Salado mining operations is drawn from the Copiapó River aquifer. Because of rapid depletion of this aquifer in recent years, Candelaria is expanding its sources of water supply. During 2010, we completed construction of a pipeline to convey reclaimed water from a nearby water treatment facility to our











Candelaria mine. We have also completed engineering and began construction for a desalination plant near the Pacific Ocean that will supply Candelaria's longer term water needs. The plant is expected to be completed in early 2013.



Although we believe each operation has sufficient water rights and claims to cover current operational demands, we cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings on our water rights, claims and uses. The loss of some or all water rights for any of our mines, or physical shortages of water to which we have rights, could require us to curtail or close mining operations and could prevent us from pursuing expansion opportunities.



Increased production costs could reduce our profitability and cash flow.



Our copper mining operations require significant energy, principally diesel, electricity, coal and natural gas. For the year2011, energy represented approximately21 percentof our consolidated copper production costs. An inability to procure sufficient energy at reasonable prices could adversely affect our profits, cash flow and growth opportunities.



Our consolidated copper production costs are also affected by the prices of commodities we consume or use in our operations, such as sulphuric acid, grinding media, steel, reagents, liners, tires, explosives and diluents. The prices of such commodities are influenced by supply and demand trends affecting the mining industry in general and other factors outside our control and such prices are at times subject to volatile movements. Increases in the cost of these commodities could make our operations less profitable. Increases in the costs of commodities that we consume or use may also significantly affect the capital costs of new projects.



In addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry, our Indonesia operations involve additional risks because they are located on unusually difficult terrain in a very remote area.



The Grasberg minerals district is located in steep mountainous terrain in a remote area of Indonesia. Because of these conditions, we have had to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities. In addition, the area receives considerable rainfall, which has led to periodic floods and mudslides. The mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time. Our insurance may not sufficiently cover an unexpected natural or operating disaster.



In October 2003, a slippage of material occurred in a section of the Grasberg open pit, resulting in eight fatalities. In December 2003, a debris flow involving a relatively small amount of loose material occurred in the same section of the open pit resulting in only minor property damage. The events caused us to alter our short-term mine sequencing plans; normal production activities resumed in second-quarter 2004.



In March 2006, a mud/topsoil slide involving approximately 75,000 metric tons of material occurred from a mountain ridge above service facilities supporting PT Freeport Indonesia's mining facilities. Three contract workers were fatally injured in the event. The material damaged a mess hall and an adjacent area. As a result of investigations by PT Freeport Indonesia and the Indonesian Department of Energy and Mineral Resources, we conducted geotechnical studies to identify and address any potential hazards to workers and facilities from slides. The existing early warning system for potential slides, based upon rainfall and other factors, has also been expanded.



In September 2008, a small scale failure encompassing approximately 75,000 metric tons of material occurred at our Grasberg open pit. There were no injuries or property damage. The event caused a delay in our access to the high-grade section of the open pit and, as a result, a portion of the metal expected to be mined in the second half of 2008 was deferred to future periods.



In April 2011, two PT Freeport Indonesia employees died in an accident when a portion of the Deep Ore Zone (DOZ) mine experienced an uncontrolled muck flow. The area was temporarily shut down during the investigation of the accident.

No assurance can be given that similar events will not occur in the future.



In addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry, our Africa mining operation involves additional risks because it is located in a remote area of the DRC.



The Tenke Fungurume minerals district is located in a remote area of the DRC and is subject to additional challenges, including:













•Severely limited infrastructure, including road, bridge and rail access that is in disrepair and receives minimal maintenance;



•Limited and possibly unreliable energy supply from antiquated equipment and from power distribution corridors that are not maintained;



•Challenges in obtaining experienced personnel;



•Security risks; and



•Limited health care in an area plagued by disease and other potential endemic health issues, including malaria and cholera.



Additionally, due to limited rail access, we currently truck a significant portion of the production from the Tenke mine approximately 1,900 miles to ports in South Africa. The Tenke Fungurume minerals district and its future development may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control, which could adversely affect their contribution to our operating results and increase the cost of future development.



The volume and grade of ore reserves that we recover and our rate of production may be more or less than anticipated.



Our ore reserve amounts are determined in accordance with Industry Guide 7 as required by the Securities Exchange Age of 1934, and are estimates of the mineral deposits that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. The determination of reserves involves numerous uncertainties with respect to the ultimate geology of the ore bodies, including quantities, grades and recovery rates, and estimates may change as new data becomes available. Estimating the quantity and grade of reserves requires us to determine the size, shape and depth or our ore bodies by analyzing geological data, such as samplings of drill holes, tunnels and other underground workings. In addition to the geology of our mines, assumptions are required to determine the economic feasibility of mining these reserves, including estimates of future commodity prices and demand, the mining methods we use and the related costs incurred to develop and mine our reserves. A sustained decrease in commodity prices may result in a reduction in economically recoverable ore reserves. These factors may result in variations in the volumes of mineral reserves that we report from period to period.



There are also uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of ore reserves and copper recovered from mill and leach stockpiles. The quantity of copper delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records. Sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grade contained in the material delivered to the mill and leach stockpiles. Processes and recovery rates are monitored regularly, and recovery rate estimates are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available and as related technology changes. Accordingly, the volume and grade of ore reserves recovered, rates of production and copper recovered from stockpiles may be less than anticipated.



We must continually replace reserves depleted by production. Our exploration activities may not result in additional discoveries.



Our ability to replenish our ore reserves is important to our long-term viability. Produced ore reserves must be replaced by further delineation of existing ore bodies or by locating new deposits in order to maintain production levels over the long term. Exploration is highly speculative in nature. Our exploration projects involve many risks, require substantial expenditures and may not result in the discovery of sufficient additional mineral deposits that can be mined profitably. Once a site with mineralization is discovered, it may take several years from the initial phases of drilling until production is possible, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change. Substantial expenditures are required to establish recoverable proven and probable reserves and to construct mining and processing facilities. As a result, there is no assurance that current or future exploration programs will be successful. There is a risk that depletion of reserves will not be offset by discoveries or acquisitions.













Development projects are inherently risky and may require more capital than anticipated, which could adversely affect our business.



There are many risks and uncertainties inherent in all development projects. The economic feasibility of development projects is based on many factors, including the accuracy of estimated reserves, metallurgical recoveries, capital and operating costs and estimated future prices of the relevant minerals. The capital expenditures and time required to develop new mines or other projects are considerable, and changes in costs or construction schedules can adversely affect project economics. Moreover, underground mining is generally more expensive than surface mining as a result of higher capital costs, including costs for modern mining equipment and construction of extensive ventilation systems. Therefore, it is possible that actual costs and economic returns may differ materially from our estimates. Refer to Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for further discussion of our current development projects.



New development projects have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future cash flow. These development projects also require the successful completion of feasibility studies, acquisition of governmental permits, acquisition of land, power and water, and ensuring that appropriate community infrastructure is developed by third parties to support such projects. It is possible that we could fail to obtain the government approvals necessary for the operation of a project, in which case, the project may not proceed, either on its original timing or at all. It is not unusual for new mining operations to experience unexpected problems during the start-up phase, resulting in delays in producing revenue and increases in capital expenditures.



The development of underground mines is subject to additional risks, including the following:



•Unanticipated geologic, geotechnical and hydrogeologic conditions;



•Challenges related to hiring and training personnel required for underground mining activities;



•Larger than expected dilution of ore associated with block caving and stoping mining methods; and



•Unanticipated delays in the development of major access and supporting infrastructure due to engineering changes, late delivery of critical components and longer than planned construction periods.



Some of these risks could result in delays to production startup and a loss or reduction in minable tons. There can be no assurance that the occurrence of such events or conditions would not have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.



Environmental risks



Our domestic and international operations are subject to complex and evolving environmental laws and regulations, and compliance with environmental and regulatory requirements involves significant costs.



Our mining operations and exploration activities, both in the U.S. and elsewhere, are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing exploration, development, production, occupational health, mine safety, toxic substances, waste disposal, protection and remediation of the environment, protection of endangered and protected species, and other related matters. Compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs, which we expect will continue to increase over time because of increased regulatory oversight, adoption of increasingly stringent environmental standards, and increased demand for remediation services leading to shortages of equipment, supplies and labor, as well as other factors. Recent examples of these trends include EPA's June 2010,  promulgation of a new sulphur dioxide ambient air standard and EPA's efforts to curtail the exemption of mining operations from waste management regulation under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. These and other such actions could have a significant impact on our operational compliance and closure costs.



In addition to compliance with environmental regulation at our operating sites, we incur significant costs for remediating environmental conditions on properties that have not been operated in many years.



Freeport-McMoRan Corporation (FMC, formerly Phelps Dodge Corporation), and many of its affiliates and predecessor companies have been involved in mining, milling, and manufacturing in the U.S. for more than a century. Activities that occurred in the late 19th century and the 20th century prior to the advent of modern environmental laws were not subject to environmental regulation and were conducted before American industrial











companies understood the long-term effects of their operations on the surrounding environment. With the passage of CERCLA in 1980, companies like FMC became legally responsible for environmental remediation on properties previously owned or operated by them, irrespective of when the damage to the environment occurred or who caused it. That liability is often shared on a joint and several basis with all other owners and operators, meaning that each owner or operator of the property is fully responsible for the clean-up, although in many cases some or all of the other historical owners or operators no longer exist, do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found. As a result, because of our acquisition of FMC in 2007, many of the subsidiary companies we now own are responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the U.S., and we expect to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address these remediation issues. We are also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources. AtDecember 31, 2011, we had more than100active remediation projects in the U.S. in27states.



AtDecember 31, 2011, we had$1.5 billionrecorded in our consolidated balance sheet for environmental obligations attributed to CERCLA or analogous state programs and for estimated future costs associated with environmental matters at closed facilities or closed portions of certain operating facilities. Our environmental obligation estimates are primarily based upon:



•Our knowledge and beliefs about complex scientific and historical facts and circumstances that in many cases involve events that occurred many decades ago;



•Our beliefs and assumptions regarding the nature, extent and duration of remediation activities that we will be required to undertake and the estimated costs of those remediation activities, which are subject to varying interpretations; and



•Our beliefs regarding the requirements that are imposed on us by existing laws and regulations and, in some cases, the expected clarification of uncertain regulatory requirements that could materially affect our environmental obligation estimates.



Significant adjustments to these estimates are likely to occur in the future as additional information becomes available. The actual environmental costs ultimately may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs, and any such changes could be material.



Refer to Note 13 for further discussion of our environmental obligations.



During2011, we incurred environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs (including our joint venture partners' shares) to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect our operations of$387 million, compared with$372 millionin2010and$289 millionin2009. For2012, we expect to incur approximately$636 millionof aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs. The timing and amounts of estimated payments could change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements, changes in scope and costs of reclamation activities, and as actual spending occurs.



An adverse ruling in one or more pending legal proceedings involving environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on us.



As described in Note 13, we are a defendant in numerous, and in some cases significant, litigation matters involving alleged environmental contamination, alleged environmental toxic torts and complex interpretations of environmental regulations. An adverse ruling in one or more of those matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.



Our Indonesia mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges, and future changes in environmental laws, or unanticipated environmental impacts from those operations, could require us to incur increased costs.



Mining operations on the scale of our Indonesia operations involve significant environmental risks and challenges. Our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of crushed and ground rock material, called tailings, that results from the process by which we physically separate the copper-, gold- and silver-bearing materials from the ore that we mine. Our tailings management plan, which has been approved by the Indonesian government, uses the river system near our mine to transport the tailings to an engineered area in the lowlands where the tailings and natural sediments are managed in a deposition area. Lateral levees have been constructed to help contain the











footprint of the tailings and to limit their impact in the lowlands.



Another major environmental challenge is managing overburden, which is the rock that must be moved aside in the mining process to reach the ore. In the presence of air, water and naturally occurring bacteria, some overburden can generate acid rock drainage, or acidic water containing dissolved metals which, if not properly managed, can adversely affect the environment.



From time to time, certain Indonesian government officials have raised questions with respect to our tailings and overburden management plans, including a suggestion that we implement a pipeline system rather than our river transport system for tailings management and disposition. Because our Indonesia mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area, a pipeline system would be costly, difficult to construct and maintain, and more prone to catastrophic failure, and could therefore involve significant potentially adverse environmental issues. Based on our own studies and others conducted by third parties, we do not believe that a pipeline system is necessary or practical.



In connection with obtaining our environmental approvals from the Indonesian government, we committed to perform a one-time environmental risk assessment on the impacts of our tailings management plan. We completed this extensive environmental risk assessment with more than 90 scientific studies conducted over four years and submitted it to the Indonesian government in December 2002. We developed the risk assessment study using internationally recognized methods with input from an independent review panel, which included representatives from the Indonesian government, academia and non-governmental organizations. The risks identified during this process were in line with our impact projections of the tailings management program contained in our environmental approval documents.



Since 2005, PT Freeport Indonesia has participated in the Government of Indonesia's PROPER (Program for Pollution Control, Evaluation and Rating) program. In November 2011, the Indonesian Ministry of Environment announced the latest results of its PROPER environmental management audit, but did not provide a rating for PT Freeport Indonesia because of the strike and security conditions that existed during 2011.  In 2010, the Indonesia Ministry of Environment issued a Blue rating acknowledging PT Freeport Indonesia's environmental management practices as being in compliance with the laws and regulations in Indonesia.



Mine closure regulations impose substantial costs on our operations.



Our U.S. operations are subject to various federal and state permitting requirements that include mine closure and mined-land reclamation obligations. These requirements are complex and vary depending upon the jurisdiction. The laws govern the determination of the scope and cost of the closure and reclamation obligations and the amount and forms of financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to meet the obligations of those plans if we are unable to do so. In general, our U.S. mines are required to review estimated closure and reclamation costs on either a periodic basis or at the time of significant permit modifications and post increasing amounts of financial assurance as required. It is uncertain how potential EPA requirements for financial assurance will affect the timing of periodic closure cost reviews or the scope of closure activities.



Our international mines are also subject to various mine closure and mined-land reclamation laws. In July 2011, the Chilean senate passed legislation relating to mine closure, which establishes new requirements for closure plans and becomes effective in November 2012. As a result, our Chilean operations will be required to update closure plans and provide financial assurance for these obligations. We cannot predict at this time the costs of these closure plans or the levels or forms of financial assurance that may be required.



AtDecember 31, 2011, we had asset retirement obligations (AROs) of$921 millionrecorded in our consolidated balance sheet. ARO cost estimates may increase or decrease significantly in the future as a result of changes in closure or financial assurance regulations, changes in engineering designs and technology, permit modifications or updates, changes in mine plans, inflation or other factors and as actual reclamation spending occurs. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion.













Regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change issues may increase our costs and adversely affect our operations and markets.



Many scientists believe that emissions from the combustion of carbon-based fuels contribute to greenhouse effects and, therefore, potentially contribute to climate change. In 2011, our worldwide total greenhouse gas emissions, measured as carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, were approximately 10 million metric tons, divided between direct (54 percent) and indirect (46 percent) emissions. Most of our direct emissions are from fuel combustion in haul trucks, followed by the combustion of fuels to provide energy for roasting, smelting and other processes. Indirect emissions are generally the emissions of outside providers from whom we purchase electricity for use in our operations. Approximately 56 percent of our direct emissions are in Indonesia, 28 percent in North America and 10 percent in South America. Approximately 58 percent of our indirect emissions are in North America and 40 percent in South America.





Since 2006, we have participated in the Carbon Disclosure Project, which is a voluntary initiative that promotes standardized reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and reduction efforts. In 2009, we formed a multi-departmental greenhouse gas task force to pursue ways to improve the energy efficiency of our operations and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including evaluating potential reductions in emissions from our haul trucks. However, because of longer and steeper mining hauls as our open pits expand and deepen, and increases in use of electricity as we increase production capacity, we expect increases in our total greenhouse gas emissions.



From a medium and long-term perspective, we are likely to experience increased costs relating to our greenhouse gas emissions as a result of regulatory initiatives in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate. In addition, the cost of electricity that we purchase from others may increase if our suppliers incur increased costs from the regulation of their greenhouse gas emissions. We cannot predict the magnitude of any increased costs at this time, given the wide scope of potential regulatory changes in the many countries in which we operate.



The potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain, and would vary by operation based on particular geographic circumstances. These may include changes in rainfall patterns, water shortages, changing sea levels, changing storm patterns and intensities, and changing temperatures. These effects may adversely impact the cost, production and financial performance of our operations.



Our operating, inactive and historical U.S. mining sites and facilities may be subject to future regulation of radioactive materials that are commonly associated with, or result from, our mining operations.



Federal and state agencies have considered proposing new regulations to characterize, regulate and remediate potential workplace exposures and environmental impacts of radioactive materials commonly associated with mining operations. For example, the EPA could promulgate rules to regulate technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive materials (TENORM) and their impacts at mining operations. In addition, several states are promulgating groundwater quality compliance and remediation standards for radioactive materials, including uranium. Radioactive materials can be associated with copper mineral deposits, including both our current and discontinued operations. Accordingly, our copper operations may generate, concentrate or release radioactive materials that may subject our operations to new and increased regulation. The impact of such future regulation on our operating, closure, reclamation, and remediation costs is uncertain.













Other risks



If market prices for our commodities decline, the carrying values of inventories and long-lived assets may be impaired, which could require charges to operating income that could be material.



Declines in the market price of copper, among other factors, could cause us to record lower of cost or market (LCM) inventory adjustments and could also result in a write-down of the carrying value of long-lived assets, which would potentially have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and stockholders' equity, but would have no effect on cash flows.



During fourth-quarter 2008, we concluded that the then-current economic environment and significant declines in copper and molybdenum prices represented significant adverse changes in our business requiring us to evaluate our long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment.  As a result, we recorded significant impairment and LCM inventory charges. Refer to Item 6. "Selected Financial Data" for a summary of these charges.



Unanticipated litigation or negative developments in pending litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.



We are a party to the litigation described in Note 13 and in Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” and a number of other litigation matters, including asbestos exposure cases, disputes over the allocation of environmental remediation obligations at Superfund and other sites, disputes over water rights and disputes with regulatory authorities. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us, limitations on our property rights, or regulatory interpretations that increase our operating costs. If any of these disputes results in a substantial monetary judgment against us or an adverse legal interpretation is settled on unfavorable terms, or otherwise affects our operations, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.



We depend on our senior management team and other key employees, and the loss of any of these employees could adversely affect our business.



Our success depends in part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate senior management and other key employees. Achieving this objective may be difficult because of many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, competitors' hiring practices, cost reduction activities, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. Competition for qualified personnel can be very intense. We must continue to recruit, retain and motivate senior management and other key employees to maintain our current business and support our future projects. A loss of such personnel could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities, and our operating results could be adversely affected.



Our holding company structure may impact your ability to receive dividends.



We are a holding company with no material assets other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to repay our indebtedness and pay dividends is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, loan, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to make funds available to us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends. Dividends from subsidiaries that are not wholly owned are shared with other equity owners. In addition, cash at our international operations is subject to foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation into the U.S.



In addition, our subsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends. Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries, may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. Our rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries' assets upon their liquidation, reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries' creditors, including any trade creditors.













Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult.



Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult. These provisions:



•Authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and to designate the rights, preferences and privileges of each class; if issued, such preferred stock would increase the number of outstanding shares of our capital stock and could include terms that may deter an acquisition of us;



•Establish advance notice requirements for nominations to the board of directors or for proposals that can be presented at stockholder meetings;



•Limit removal of directors for cause only;



•Limit who may call stockholder meetings; and



•Require the approval of the holders of two thirds of our outstanding common stock to enter into certain business combination transactions, subject to certain exceptions, including if the consideration to be received by our common stockholders in the transaction is deemed to be a fair price.



These provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our board of directors.



In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger with, or acquisition of, us.



These provisions may deter an acquisition of us that might otherwise be attractive to stockholders.
