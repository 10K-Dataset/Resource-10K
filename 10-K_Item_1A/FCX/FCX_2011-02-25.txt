Item 1A. Risk Factors

This report contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements are all statements other than statements of historical facts, such as statements regarding anticipated production volumes, unit net cash costs, sales volumes, ore grades, milling rates, commodity prices, development and capital expenditures, mine production and development plans, availability of power, water, labor and equipment, environmental reclamation and closure costs and plans, environmental liabilities and expenditures, litigation expense and results, dividend payments, potential prepayments of debt, reserve estimates, exploration efforts and results, operating cash flows, the impact of copper, gold, molybdenum and cobalt price changes, deferred intercompany profit impacts o
n financial results, and anticipated political, economic and social conditions in our areas of operations. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially from those projected, anticipated or assumed in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements include the following.



Financial risks



Extended declines in the market prices of copper, gold and/or molybdenum could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows and, if sustained, could adversely affect our ability to repay debt. Fluctuations in the market prices of copper, gold or molybdenum can cause significant volatility in our financial performance and adversely affect the trading prices of our debt and equity securities.



Our financial results are affected significantly by the market prices of copper and, to a lesser extent, gold and molybdenum (for further information about movements in the market prices of these commodities, refer to discussion below and Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”). An extended decline in the market prices of these commodities could (1) adversely affect our financial results, (2) adversely affect our ability to repay our debt and meet our other fixed obligations, and (3) depress the trading prices of our common stock and of our publicly traded debt securities.



Substantially all of our copper concentrate and cathode sales contracts provide final pricing in a specified future period (generally one to four months from the shipment date) based primarily on quoted London Metal Exchange (LME) monthly average spot prices. Accordingly, in times of rising copper prices, our revenues benefit from higher prices received for contracts priced at current market rates and also from an increase related to the final pricing of provisionally priced sales pursuant to contracts entered into in prior periods. However, in times of falling copper prices, the opposite occurs.



There continues to be uncertainty in the global economy, which could negatively affect the market prices of commodities, including the metals that we produce. If market prices for the metals we produce decline for a sustained period of time, we may have to revise our operating plans, including curtailing production, reducing operating costs and capital expenditures and discontinuing certain exploration and development programs. We may be unable to decrease our costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues, and may incur losses.



Copper prices have fluctuated historically, with LME spot copper prices ranging from $1.26 to $4.42 per pound during the three years ended December 31, 2010. The LME spot copper price closed at $4.50 per pound on February 11, 2011. Copper prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including:



·The strength of the U.S. economy and the economies of other industrialized and developing nations, including China, which has become the largest consumer of refined copper in the world;



·Available supplies of copper from mine production and inventories;



·Sales by holders and producers of copper;



·Demand for industrial products containing copper;



·Investment activity, including speculation, in copper as a commodity;



·The availability and cost of substitute materials; and





·Currency exchange fluctuations, including the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar.



Gold prices have also fluctuated historically, with London gold prices ranging from $713 to $1,421 per ounce for the three years ended December 31, 2010. London gold prices closed at $1,364 per ounce on February 11, 2011. Gold prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including:



·The strength of the U.S. economy and the economies of other industrialized and developing nations, including China;



·Global or regional political or economic crises;



·The relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar and other currencies;



·Expectations with respect to the rate of inflation;



·Interest rates;



·Purchases and sales of gold by governments, central banks and other holders;



·Demand for jewelry containing gold; and



·Investment activity, including speculation, in gold as a commodity.



Molybdenum prices also fluctuate, with theMetals WeekMolybdenum Dealer Oxide weekly average price ranging from $7.83 to $33.88 per pound for the three years ended December 31, 2010. TheMetals WeekMolybdenum Dealer Oxide weekly average price was $17.58 per pound on February 11, 2011. Molybdenum prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including:



·The worldwide balance of molybdenum demand and supply;



·Rates of global economic growth, especially construction and infrastructure activity that requires significant amounts of steel;



·The volume of molybdenum produced as a by-product of copper production;



·Inventory levels;



·Currency exchange fluctuations, including the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar; and



·Production costs of U.S. and foreign competitors.



Under U.S. federal and state laws that require closure and reclamation plans for our mines, we generally are required to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement those plans if we are unable to do so. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state agencies may seek financial assurance for investigation and remediation actions under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) or equivalent state regulations.The failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us.



We generally are required by U.S. federal and state laws to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans if we are unable to do so. These laws are complex and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The laws govern the determination of the scope and cost of the closure and reclamation obligations and the amount and forms of financial assurance.



EPA and state agencies may seek financial assurance for investigation and remediation actions under CERCLA or equivalent state regulations. In July 2009, EPA published a Priority Notice of Action identifying classes of facilities within the hardrock mining industry for which the agency will develop financial responsibility requirements





concerning the degree and duration of risk associated with the production, transportation, treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous substances. It is uncertain how the new requirements, if promulgated, will affect the amount and form of our existing and future financial assurance obligations.





Mine closure regulations impose substantial 
costs on our operations



The agreements governing our indebtedness require us to meet certain financial tests and other covenants and as a result may limit our flexibility in the operation of our business and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.



At December 31, 2010, the outstanding principal amount of our debt was $4.8 billion. The agreements governing our indebtedness restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our ability to:



·Incur additional indebtedness;



·Engage in transactions with affiliates;



·Create liens on our assets;



·Make payments in respect of equity issued by us or our subsidiaries, including the payment of dividends on our common stock;



·Make investments in, or loans, to entities that we do not control, including joint ventures;



·Sell assets;



·Merge with or into other companies;



·Enter into sale and leaseback transactions;



·Enter into unrelated businesses;



·Enter into agreements or arrangements that restrict the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or other distributions;



·Prepay indebtedness; and



·Enter into hedging transactions other than in the ordinary course of business.



Because the ratings on our senior notes are investment grade, the restrictions contained in our 8.375% and 8.25% Senior Notes on incurring debt, making restricted payments and selling assets are currently suspended. To the extent the rating is downgraded below investment grade by both S&P and Moody’s, the covenants would again become effective. Our revolving credit facilities contain restrictions on the amount available for dividend





payments, purchases of our common stock and certain debt prepayments. However, these restrictions do not apply as long as availability under the revolvers plus domestic cash exceeds $750 million. At December 31, 2010, we had availability under the revolvers plus available domestic cash (as defined by the revolving credit facilities) of approximately $4.1 billion. Refer to Note 9 for further discussion.



In addition, our revolving credit facilities require that we meet certain financial tests at any time that borrowings are outstanding under these facilities, including a leverage ratio test (Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the facility, for the preceding four quarters cannot exceed 5.0 to 1.0 on the last day of any fiscal quarter) and a secured leverage ratio test (Total Secured Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the facility, for the preceding four quarters cannot exceed 3.0 to 1.0 on the last day of any fiscal quarter). During periods in which copper, gold or molybdenum prices or production volumes, or other conditions reflect the adverse impact of cyclical market trends or other factors, we may not be able to comply with the applicable financial covenants.



Our obligations under our revolving credit facilities are (1) guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries and (2) secured by a pledge of (a) 100 percent of the equity in substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries and (b) 66.5 percent of the equity in substantially all of our first tier foreign subsidiaries.



Any failure to comply with the restrictions of our revolving credit facilities, senior notes or any agreement governing our other indebtedness, after giving effect to any applicable grace period, may result in an event of default. Such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt, which may trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions in other debt agreements. We would not be able to fully repay when due borrowings under our debt instruments that are accelerated upon an event of default.



If we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our indebtedness under, or amend the covenants contained in, our senior credit agreements at maturity or in the event of a default, the lenders under our revolving credit facilities could terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making further loans, declare all borrowings outstanding (together with accrued interest and other fees) immediately due and payable and institute foreclosure proceedings against the collateral. Any such actions could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.



Movements in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively affect our operating results.



The functional currency for most of our operations is the U.S. dollar. All of our revenues and a significant portion of our costs are denominated in U.S. dollars; however, some costs and certain asset and liability accounts are denominated in local currencies, including the Indonesian rupiah, Australian dollar, Chilean peso, Peruvian nuevo sol and euro. Generally, our results are adversely affected when the U.S. dollar weakens in relation to those foreign currencies. Refer to Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a summary of the estimated impact of changes in foreign currency rates on our annual operating costs.



From time to time, we may implement currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange. However, our hedging strategies may not be successful, and any of our unhedged foreign exchange payments will continue to be subject to market fluctuations.



Operational risks



Our business is subject to operational risks that could adversely affect our business.



Mines by their nature are subject to many operational risks, some of which are outside of our control. These operational risks, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and cash flows, include the following:



·Earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters;



·The occurrence of unusual weather or operating conditions and other force majeure events;



·The failure of equipment or processes to operate in accordance with specifications, design or expectations;





·Accidents;



·Wall failures and rock slides in our open pit mines, and structural collapses in our underground mines;



·Problems associated with the construction and management of large impoundments containing tailings or other viscous or semi-solid materials, some of which also contain mineral and chemical contaminants, such as structural failures or leakages;



·Interruption of energy supply;



·Lower than expected ore grades or recovery rates;



·Metallurgical and other processing problems;



·Unanticipated ground and water conditions;



·Adverse claims to water rights and shortages of water to which we have rights;



·Adjacent land ownership or usage that results in constraints on current or future mine operations;



·Delays in the receipt of or failure to receive necessary government permits;



·Delays in transportation and disruptions of supply routes;



·Labor disputes; and



·The inability to obtain satisfactory insurance coverage.



The failure to adequately manage some of these risks could result in significant personal injury, loss of life, property damage and damage to the environment, both on and outside our operating sites, as well as damage to production facilities and delays in production.



Our mining production depends on the availability of sufficient water supplies.





Water for our Candelaria and Ojos del Salado mining operations is drawn from the Copiapó River aquifer. Because of rapid depletion of this aquifer in recent years, studies have been ongoing to assess available supply for these operations. Based on these studies, we have begun to develop replacement supplies from renewable sources. We recently completed construction of a pipeline to convey reclaimed water from a nearby waste water treatment facility to our Candelaria mine. We have also started engineering for the construction of a desalination plant near the Pacific Ocean to treat seawater and a pipeline to convey the water to Candelaria. The plant is expected to be completed by the end of 2012.



Water for our El Abra mining operations comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the Salar de





Ascotán. In 2010, we obtained regulatory approval, subject to certain conditions, for the continued pumping of groundwater from the Salar de Ascotán for the Sulfolix processing plant, which will begin operations in 2011. Failure to meet the specified conditions could adversely affect the Sulfolix processing plant. A change to the sulfide ore project, such as increased production or mill processing, would require additional water beyond our Sulfolix ground water pumping, which is permitted through 2021. El Abra is also conducting studies to assess the feasibility of constructing a desalination plant near the Pacific Ocean to treat seawater for possible increased sulfide ore production or mill processing.



Water for our Cerro Verde mining operations comes from a series of storage reservoirs in the Rio Chili watershed that collect runoff from seasonal precipitation. Our Cerro Verde mining operations recently constructed new water reservoirs on the Rio Chili watershed to obtain additional water rights and to expand storage capacity in the watershed. Due to occasional drought and possibility that climate change will reduce precipitation levels, temporary supply shortages are possible that could affect our operations as currently planned. Cerro Verde is conducting water studies to assess opportunities for additional supplies to support current operations and potential future expansion projects.



Although each operation has sufficient water rights and claims to cover current operational demands, we cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings on our water rights, claims and uses. The loss of some or all water rights for any of our mines, in whole or in part, or shortages of water to which we have rights could require us to curtail or close mining production and could prevent us from pursuing expansion opportunities.



Increased production costs could reduce our profitability and cash flow.



Energy represents approximately 20 percent of our production costs. An inability to procure sufficient energy at reasonable prices could adversely affect our profits, cash flow and growth opportunities. Our production costs are also affected by the prices of commodities we consume or use in our operations, such as sulphuric acid, grinding media, steel, reagents, liners, explosives and diluents. The prices of such commodities are influenced by supply and demand trends affecting the mining industry in general and other factors outside our control and such prices are at times subject to volatile movements. Increases in the cost of these commodities could make our operations less profitable. Increases in the costs of commodities that we consume or use may also significantly affect the capital costs of new projects.



In addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry, our Indonesia operations involve additional risks because they are located on unusually difficult terrain in a very remote area.



Our Grasberg mining operations are located in steep mountainous terrain in a very remote area in Indonesia. Because of these conditions, we have had to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities. In addition, the area receives considerable rainfall, which has led to periodic floods and mudslides. The mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time. Our insurance may not sufficiently cover an unexpected natural or operating disaster.



In October 2003, a slippage of material occurred in a section of the Grasberg open pit, resulting in eight fatalities. In December 2003, a debris flow involving a relatively small amount of loose material occurred in the same section of the open pit resulting in only minor property damage. The events caused us to alter our short-term mine sequencing plans, which adversely affected our 2003 and 2004 production. We resumed normal production activities in second-quarter 2004.



In March 2006, a mud/topsoil slide involving approximately 75,000 metric tons of material occurred from a mountain ridge above service facilities supporting PT Freeport Indonesia’s mining facilities. Three contract workers were fatally injured in the event. The material damaged a mess hall and an adjacent area. As a result of investigations by PT Freeport Indonesia and the Indonesian Department of Energy and Mineral Resources, we conducted geotechnical studies to identify and address any potential hazards to workers and facilities from slides. The existing early warning system for potential slides, based upon rainfall and other factors, has also been expanded.



In September 2008, a small scale failure encompassing approximately 75,000 metric tons of material occurred at our Grasberg open pit. There were no injuries or property damage. The event caused a delay in our access to the high-grade section of the open pit and, as a result, a portion of the metal expected to be mined in the second half





of 2008 was deferred to future periods.



No assurance can be given that similar events will not occur in the future.



Our Africa mining operation, Tenke Fungurume, involves additional risks because it is located in a remote area of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).



Our Tenke Fungurume mining operation is located in a remote area of the DRC and is subject to additional challenges, including:



·Severely limited infrastructure, including road, bridge and rail access that is in disrepair and receives minimal maintenance;



·Limited and possibly unreliable energy supply from antiquated equipment and from power distribution corridors that are not maintained;



·Challenges in obtaining experienced personnel;



·Security risks; and



·Limited health care in an area plagued by disease and other potential endemic health issues, including malaria and cholera.



For example, due to limited rail access, we currently truck a significant portion of the production from our Tenke Fungurume mining operation approximately 1,900 miles to ports in South Africa. The Tenke Fungurume mining operation and future development may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control, which could adversely affect their contribution to our operating results and increase the cost of future development.



An interruption of energy supply could adversely affect our mining operations.



Our mining operations and development projects require significant energy, principally electricity, diesel, coal and natural gas. Our South America mining operations receive electrical power under long-term contracts with local energy companies. Our Africa mining operation has entered into long-term power supply and infrastructure funding agreements with the state-owned electric utility company serving the Katanga province of the DRC. A disruption in the transmission of energy, inadequate energy transmission infrastructure, or the termination of any of our energy supply contracts could interrupt our energy supply and adversely affect our operations.



The volume and grade of ore reserves that we recover and our rate of production may be more or less than anticipated.



Our ore reserve amounts are determined in accordance with established mining industry practices and standards, and are estimates of the mineral deposits that can be recovered economically and legally based on currently available data. Estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves are subject to considerable uncertainty. Ore bodies may not conform to standard geological expectations, and estimates may change as new data becomes available. Because ore bodies do not contain uniform grades and types of minerals, our metal recovery rates will vary from time to time.



Additionally, because the determination of reserves is based partially on estimates of future selling prices, a sustained decrease in such prices may result in a reduction in economically recoverable ore reserves. These factors may result in variations in the volumes of mineral reserves that we report from period to period.



There are also uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of ore reserves and copper recovered from stockpiles. The quantity of copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records. The volume and grade of ore reserves recovered, rates of production and recovered copper from stockpiles may be less than anticipated. During fourth-quarter 2010, revised recovery rate estimates at El Abra resulted in a reduction of 163 million pounds in leach stockpiles.





We must continually replace reserves depleted by production. Our exploration activities may not result in additional discoveries.



Our ability to replenish our ore reserves is important to our long-term viability. Produced ore reserves must be replaced by further delineation of existing ore bodies or by locating new deposits in order to maintain production levels over the long term. Exploration is highly speculative in nature. Our exploration projects involve many risks, require substantial expenditures and may not result in the discovery of sufficient additional mineral deposits that can be mined profitably. Once a site with mineralization is discovered, it may take several years from the initial phases of drilling until production is possible, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change. Substantial expenditures are required to establish recoverable proven and probable reserves and to construct mining and processing facilities. As a result, 
there is no assurance that current or future exploration programs will be successful. There is a risk that depletion of reserves will not be offset by discoveries or acquisitions.



Development projects are inherently risky and may require more capital than anticipated, which could adversely affect our business.



There are many risks and uncertainties inherent in all development projects, including the development of underground mines in the Grasberg minerals district and our development of a large sulfide deposit at our El Abra mine. The economic feasibility of development projects is based on many factors, including the accuracy of estimated reserves, metallurgical recoveries, capital and operating costs and future prices of the relevant minerals. The capital expenditures and time required to develop new mines or other projects are considerable, and changes in costs or construction schedules can affect project economics. Moreover, underground mining is generally more expensive than surface mining as a result of higher capital costs, including costs for modern mining equipment and construction of extensive ventilation systems. Thus it is possible
 that actual costs and economic returns may differ materially from our estimates.



New development projects have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future cash flow. These development projects also require the successful completion of feasibility studies, acquisition of governmental permits, acquisition of land, power and water, and ensuring that appropriate community infrastructure is developed by third parties to support such projects. It is possible that we could fail to obtain the government approvals necessary for the operation of a project, in which case, the project may not proceed, either on its original timing or at all. It is not unusual for new mining operations to experience unexpected problems during the start-up phase, resulting in delays in producing revenue and increases in capital expenditures.



The development of underground mines is subject to additional risks, including the following:



·Unanticipated geologic, geotechnical and hydrogeologic conditions;



·Challenges related to hiring and training the personnel required for the ramp up in underground mining activities;



·Larger than expected dilution of ore associated with block caving and stoping mining methods; and



·Unanticipated delays in the development of major access and supporting infrastructure due to engineering changes, late delivery of critical components and longer than planned construction periods.



Some of these risks could result in a delay to production start up and a loss or reduction in minable tons. There can be no assurance that the occurrence of such events or conditions would not have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.



Environmental risks



Our domestic and international operations are subject to complex and evolving environmental laws and regulations, and compliance with environmental and regulatory requirements involves significant costs.



Our ongoing mining operations and exploration activities, both in the U.S. and elsewhere, are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing exploration, development, production, occupational health, mine safety, toxic





substances, waste disposal, protection and remediation of the environment, protection of endangered and protected species, and other related matters. Compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs and we expect these costs to continue to increase in the future because of increased regulatory enforcement, increased demand for remediation services and shortages of equipment, supplies, labor and other factors. The Federal Clean Air Act has had a significant impact, particularly on our domestic smelter and power plants. Any change in waste management regulation of the mining industry under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act could have a significant impact, both on operational compliance and closure costs. In addition, environmental laws and regulations may change in ways that could substantially increase 
compliance costs or adversely affect our operations or expansion opportunities.



In addition to compliance with environmental regulation at our operating sites, we incur significant costs for remediating environmental conditions on properties that have not been operated in many years.





We incurred aggregate environmental capital expenditure and other environmental costs (including our joint venture partners’ shares) to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations of $372 million in 2010, $289 million in 2009 and $377 million in 2008. The increase in environmental capital spending for 2010, compared with 2009, primarily related to settlement of legal proceedings (refer to Note 13 for further discussion). For 2011, we expect to incur approximately $460 million of aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs, which are part of our overall 2011 operating budget and primarily relates to ongoing environmental compliance.



At December 31, 2010, $1.4 billion of environmental obligations were recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. Our environmental obligation estimates are based upon (1) our knowledge and beliefs about complex scientific and historical facts and circumstances that in many cases involve events that occurred many decades ago, (2) our beliefs and assumptions regarding the nature, extent and duration of remediation activities that we will be required to undertake the estimated costs of those activities, which are subject to varying interpretations, and (3) our beliefs regarding the requirements that are imposed on us by existing laws and regulations and, in some cases, the expected clarification of uncertain regulatory requirements that could materially affect our environmental obligation estimates. Significant adjustments to these estimates
 are likely to occur in the future as additional information becomes available. The actual environmental costs ultimately may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs, and any such changes could be material. Refer to Note 13 for more information on our environmental obligations.



An adverse ruling in one or more pending legal proceedings involving environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on us.



As described in Note 13 and Item 3. “Legal Proceedings”, we are a defendant in numerous and in some cases significant litigation involving environmental cleanup costs, alleged environmental toxic torts and interpretations of environmental regulations. An adverse ruling in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.





Mine closure regulations impose substantial costs on our operations.



Our domestic operations are subject to various federal and state permitting requirements that include mine closure and mined-land reclamation obligations. These requirements are complex and vary depending upon the jurisdiction. The laws govern the determination of the scope and cost of the closure and reclamation obligations and the amount and forms of financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to meet the obligations of those plans if we are unable to do so. In general, our domestic mines are required to review estimated closure and reclamation costs on either a periodic basis or at the time of significant permit modifications and post increasing amounts of financial assurance as required. It is uncertain how potential EPA requirements for financial assurance will affect the timing of periodic closure cost reviews or the 
scope of closure activities.



In addition, our international mines are subject to various mine closure and mined-land reclamation laws, and there have recently been significant changes in closure and reclamation programs in both Peru and Chile that impose more stringent obligations on us for closure and reclamation.



At December 31, 2010, our asset retirement obligations (AROs), determined as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. totaled $856 million (including $405 million for our New Mexico operations, $214 million for our Arizona operations and $129 million for PT Freeport Indonesia). ARO cost estimates may increase or decrease significantly in the future as a result of changes in closure or financial assurance regulations, engineering designs and technology, permit modifications or updates, mine plans, cost of inflation or other factors and as actual reclamation spending occurs.



Regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change issues may increase our costs and adversely affect our operations and markets.



Many scientists believe that emissions from the combustion of carbon-based fuels contribute to greenhouse effects and therefore potentially to climate change. In 2010, our worldwide total greenhouse gas emissions, measured as carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, were approximately 10 million metric tons, divided between direct (56 percent) and indirect (44 percent) emissions. Most of our direct emissions are from fuel combustion in haul trucks, followed by the combustion of fuels to provide energy for roasting, smelting and other processes. Indirect emissions are generally the emissions of outside providers from whom we purchase electricity for use in our operations. Approximately 64 percent of our direct emissions are in Indonesia, 21 percent in North America and 10 percent in South America. Approximately 56 percent of our indirect emiss
ions are in North America and 42 percent in South America.





Since 2006, we have participated in the Carbon Disclosure Project, which is a voluntary initiative that promotes standardized reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and reduction efforts. In 2009, we formed a multi-departmental greenhouse gas task force. Under the direction of this task force, we actively pursue ways to improve the energy efficiency of our operations and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including evaluating





potential reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from our haul trucks. However, as a result of possible increases in production rates and longer and steeper haul profiles for the next several years, we also expect increases in our total greenhouse gas emissions.



From a medium and long-term perspective, we are likely to see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit significant amounts of greenhouse gases as a result of regulatory initiatives in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate. In addition, the cost of electricity that we purchase from others may increase, if they incur increased costs from the regulation of their greenhouse gas emissions. We cannot predict the magnitude of any increased costs at this time, given the wide scope of potential regulatory changes in the many countries in which we operate.



The potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain, and would be particular to the geographic circumstances. These may include changes in rainfall patterns, water shortages, changing sea levels, changing storm patterns and intensities, and changing temperatures. These effects may adversely impact the cost, production and financial performance of our operations.



Our operating, inactive and historical U.S. mining sites and facilities may be subject to future regulation of radioactive materials that are commonly associated with, or result from, our mining operations.



A number of federal and state agencies are considering new regulations to characterize, regulate and remediate potential workplace exposures and environmental impacts of radioactive materials commonly associated with mining operations. For example, the EPA could promulgate rules to regulate technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive materials (TENORM) and their impacts at mining operations. In addition, several states are promulgating groundwater quality compliance and remediation standards for radioactive materials, including uranium. Radioactive materials can be associated with copper mineral deposits, including both our current and discontinued operations. Consequently, our copper operations may generate, concentrate or release radioactive materials that may subject our operations to new and increased regulation
. The impact of such future regulation on our operating, closure, reclamation, and remediation costs is uncertain.



Our Indonesia mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges, and future changes in environmental laws, or unanticipated environmental impacts from those operations, could require us to incur increased costs.



Mining operations on the scale of our operations in Papua involve significant environmental risks and challenges. Our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of crushed and ground rock material, called tailings, that results from the process by which we physically separate the copper-, gold- and silver-bearing materials from the ore that we mine. Our tailings management plan, which has been approved by the Government of Indonesia, uses the river system near our mine to transport the tailings to an engineered area in the lowlands where the tailings and natural sediments are managed in a deposition area. Lateral levees have been engineered and constructed to limit and help contain the footprint of tailings impact in the lowlands.



Another major environmental challenge is managing overburden, which is the rock that must be moved aside in the mining process in order to reach the ore. In the presence of air, water and naturally occurring bacteria, some overburden can generate acid rock drainage, or acidic water containing dissolved metals which, if not properly managed, can have a negative impact on the environment.



Certain Indonesian governmental officials have from time to time raised questions with respect to our tailings and overburden management plans, including a suggestion that we implement a pipeline system rather than our river transport system for tailings management and disposition. Because our mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area, a pipeline system would be costly, difficult to construct and maintain, and more prone to catastrophic failure, and could therefore involve significant potentially adverse environmental issues. Based on our own studies and others conducted by third parties, we do not believe that a pipeline system is necessary or practical.



In connection with obtaining our environmental approvals from the Indonesian government, we committed to perform a one-time environmental risk assessment on the impacts of our tailings management plan. We completed this extensive environmental risk assessment with more than 90 scientific studies conducted over four years and submitted it to the Indonesian government in December 2002. We developed the risk assessment study using internationally recognized methods with input from an independent review panel, which included





representatives from the Indonesian government, academia and non-governmental organizations. The risks identified during this process were in line with our impact projections of the tailings management program contained in our environmental approval documents.



Since 2005, PT Freeport Indonesia has participated in the Government of Indonesia’s PROPER (Program for Pollution Control, Evaluation and Rating) program. In November 2010, the Indonesian Ministry of Environment announced the latest results of its PROPER environmental management audit, and gave PT Freeport Indonesia a Blue rating acknowledging PT Freeport Indonesia’s environmental management practices as being in compliance with the laws and regulations in Indonesia and also making several recommendations for improvement.



International risks



Our international operations are subject to political, social and geographic risks of doing business in foreign countries.



We are a global mining company with substantial assets located outside of the U.S. We conduct international mining operations in Indonesia, Peru, Chile and the DRC. Accordingly, our business may be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties in each of these countries, in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in foreign countries. Such risks include (1) renegotiation, cancellation or forced modification of existing contracts, (2) expropriation or nationalization of property, (3) changes in a foreign country’s laws, regulations and policies, including those relating to labor, taxation, royalties, divestment, imports, exports, trade regulations, currency and environmental matters, (4) political instability, bribery, extortion, corruption, civil strife, acts of war, guerilla activities, 
insurrection and terrorism, (5) foreign exchange controls, and (6) the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel or having to enforce the judgment of a foreign court or arbitration panel against a sovereign nation within its own territory. Our insurance does not cover most losses caused by these risks. Consequently, our exploration, development and production activities outside of the U.S. could be substantially affected by factors beyond our control, some of which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations.



In October 2010, PT Freeport Indonesia received from the Indonesian tax authorities an assessment for additional taxes approximating $106 million and interest approximating $52 million related to various audit exceptions for 2005. PT Freeport Indonesia has filed objections to these assessments because it believes that it has properly paid taxes for the year 2005 and is working with the Indonesian tax authorities to resolve this matter.



In December 2009, PT Freeport Indonesia was notified by the Large Taxpayer’s Office of the Government of Indonesia that PT Freeport Indonesia is obligated to pay value added taxes on certain goods imported after the year 2000. The amount of taxes and penalties would be significant. PT Freeport Indonesia believes that pursuant to the terms of its Contract of Work, it is only required to pay value added taxes on these types of goods imported after December 30, 2009. PT Freeport Indonesia has not received an assessment and is working with the applicable government authorities to resolve this matter.







Because our Grasberg minerals district in Papua, Indonesia remains our most significant operating asset, our business may continue to be adversely affected by Indonesian political, economic and social uncertainties.



Indonesia has faced political, economic and social uncertainties, including separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces. In particular, several separatist groups are opposing Indonesian rule over the province of Papua, where our Grasberg minerals district is located, and have sought political independence for the province. In response, Indonesia enacted regional autonomy laws, which became effective January 1, 2001. The manner in which the new laws are being implemented and the degree of political and economic autonomy that they may bring to individual provinces, including Papua, are uncertain and are ongoing issues in Indonesian politics. In Papua, there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the Indonesian military.
 Social, economic and political instability in Papua could materially and adversely affect us if it results in damage to our property or interruption of our activities.



Maintaining a good working relationship with the Indonesian government is important to us because our mining operations there are among Indonesia’s most significant business enterprises and are conducted pursuant to a Contract of Work with the Indonesian government. Partially because of their significance to Indonesia’s economy, the environmentally sensitive area in which they are located, and the number of people employed, our operations are occasionally the subject of criticism in the Indonesian press and in political debates, and have been the target of protests and occasional violence.



Between July 2009 and January 2010 there were a series of shooting incidents along the road leading to our mining and milling operations at our Grasberg mining complex. In connection with these incidents, there were three fatalities (including one PT Freeport Indonesia employee, a security contractor and an Indonesian policeman) and several injuries. The Indonesian government responded with additional security forces and expressed a strong commitment to protect the safety of the community and of our operations.



PT Freeport Indonesia operated at reduced mining and milling rates during a four-day period in April 2007, as a result of peaceful protests by certain workers regarding benefits. The protests ended with an agreement on a framework for minimum wages for workers and PT Freeport Indonesia returned to normal operations. The impacts to production were not significant.



Illegal miners have continued to operate along the river designated to transport the tailings from the mill to the lowlands in PT Freeport Indonesia’s government-approved tailings management area. The illegal miners who have trespassed from time to time in the area of our facilities have clashed with police who have attempted to move them away from our facilities. In 2006, the illegal miners temporarily blocked the road leading to the Grasberg mine and mill in protest, and PT Freeport Indonesia temporarily suspended mining and milling operations as a precautionary measure.



We cannot predict whether additional incidents will occur that could disrupt our Indonesian operations, or whether similar incidents may occur in other countries that could affect our other operations. If additional protests or other disruptive incidents occur at any of our facilities, they could adversely affect our business and profitability in ways that we cannot predict at this time.



We do not expect to mine all of our Indonesian ore reserves before the initial term of our Contract of Work in Indonesia expires.



All of our Indonesian proven and probable ore reserves, including the Grasberg deposit, are located in Block A, and the initial term of our Contract of Work covering these ore reserves expires at the end of 2021. We can extend this term for two successive 10-year periods, subject to the approval of the Indonesian government, which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably. Our ore reserves reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041 (i.e., through the expiration of the two 10-year extensions) and our current mine plan has been developed, and our operations are based on the assumption that we will receive the two 10-year extensions. As a result, we will not mine all of these ore reserves during the current term of our Contract of Work, and there can be no assurance that the Indonesian government will approv
e the extensions. Prior to the end of 2021, we expect to mine 32 percent of aggregate proven and probable recoverable ore at December 31, 2010, representing 38 percent of PT Freeport Indonesia’s share of recoverable copper reserves and 51 percent of its share of





recoverable gold reserves.



In 2008, Indonesia enacted a new mining law, which will operate under a licensing system as opposed to the contract of work system that applies to PT Freeport Indonesia. In 2010, the Government of Indonesia promulgated regulations under the 2008 mining law and certain provisions address existing contracts of work.  The regulations provide that contracts of work will continue to be honored until their expiration. However, the regulations attempt to apply certain provisions of the new law to any extension periods of contracts of work even though our Contract of Work provides for two 10-year extension periods under the existing terms of the Contract of Work.



Our Contracts of Work in Indonesia are subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations, and if a dispute arises, we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel.



PT Freeport Indonesia’s Contract of Work and other Contracts of Work in which we have an interest were entered into under Indonesia’s 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law, which provides guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization. Our Contracts of Work can be terminated by the Government of Indonesia if we do not satisfy our contractual obligations, which include the payment of royalties and taxes to the government and the satisfaction of certain mining, environmental, safety and health requirements.



Certain forestry laws and designations as well as prevailing environmental laws and regulations may conflict with or overlap with the mining rights established under our Contract of Work. Although our Contract of Work grants to PT Freeport Indonesia the unencumbered right to operate in accordance with the Contract of Work, certain government agencies could seek to impose additional restrictions on PT Freeport Indonesia that could affect exploration and operating requirements.



At times, certain government officials and others in Indonesia have questioned the validity of contracts entered into by the Government of Indonesia prior to May 1998 (i.e., during the Suharto regime, which lasted over 30 years), including PT Freeport Indonesia’s Contract of Work, which was signed in December 1991. We cannot provide assurance that the validity of, or our compliance with, the Contracts of Work will not be challenged for political or other reasons. PT Freeport Indonesia’s Contract of Work and our other Contracts of Work require that disputes with the Indonesian government be submitted to international arbitration. Consequently, if a dispute arises under the Contracts of Work, we face the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel, and if we prevail in such a dispute
, we will face the additional risk of having to enforce the judgment of a foreign court or arbitration panel against Indonesia within its own territory.



Indonesian government officials have periodically undertaken reviews regarding our compliance with Indonesian environmental laws and regulations and the terms of the Contracts of Work. In 2006, the Government of Indonesia created a joint team for “Periodic Evaluation on Implementation of the PT-FI Contract of Work” to conduct an evaluation every five years. The team consists of five working groups, whose members are from relevant ministries or agencies, covering production, state revenues, community development, environmental issues and security issues. We have conducted numerous meetings with these groups. The joint team has indicated that it will issue a report. While we believe that we comply with PT Freeport Indonesia’s Contract of Work in all material respects, we cannot provide assurance that the report will s
upport that conclusion. Separately, the Indonesian House of Representatives created a working committee on PT Freeport Indonesia. Members of this group have also visited our operations and held a number of hearings in Jakarta. We will continue to work with these groups to respond to their questions about our operations and our compliance with PT Freeport Indonesia’s Contract of Work.



Any suspension of required activities under our Contracts of Work requires the consent of the Indonesian government.



Our Contracts of Work permit us to suspend certain contractually required activities, including exploration, for a period of one year by making a written request to the Indonesian government. These requests are subject to the approval of the Indonesian government and are renewable annually. If we do not request a suspension or are denied a suspension, then we are required to continue our activities under the Contract of Work or potentially be declared in default. Moreover, if a suspension continues for more than one year for reasons other than force majeure and the Indonesian government has not approved such continuation, then the government would be entitled to declare a default under the Contract of Work.





We suspended our field exploration activities outside of Block A in recent years because of safety and security issues and regulatory uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest areas and an Indonesian Forestry law enacted in 1999 prohibiting open-pit mining in forest preservation areas. In 2001, we requested and received from the Government of Indonesia, formal temporary suspensions of our obligations under the Contracts of Work in all areas outside of Block A. Recent Indonesian legislation permits open-pit mining in PT Freeport Indonesia’s Block B area, subject to certain requirements. Following an assessment of these requirements and a review of security issues, in 2007 we resumed exploration activities in certain prospective Contract of Work areas outside of Block A.



Our Tenke Fungurume mining operation is located in the Katanga province of the DRC, and may be adversely affected by political, economic and social instability in the DRC.





In July 2009, TFM was advised that the Minister of Justice in the DRC authorized an inquiry regarding the alleged misappropriation of public funds in connection with the securing of labor and immigration authorizations and the payment of associated fees for the Tenke Fungurume project. Several government officials and three TFM employees were arrested. In October 2009, the three TFM employees were tried and acquitted. One government official, the head of immigration in the Katanga province, was sentenced to five years imprisonment on charges of embezzlement. The office of the Attorney General of the DRC filed a notice of appeal of the judgment, and the matter is pending at the Appellate Court.



In July 2009, TFM entered into a settlement agreement with DRC tax authorities in connection with an administrative audit regarding the payment of fees for work permits and visas for its foreign workers and subcontractors, including short-term workers. Pursuant to the agreement, which covers the period from January 2007 to the date of the settlement, TFM paid approximately $16 million in fees and penalties. The procedures associated with obtaining labor and immigration authorizations for short-term workers on a timely basis are not clearly established in the DRC, and TFM continues to work proactively and cooperatively with the government authorities to establish approved procedures for doing so consistent with its mining convention and local law. In connection with this matter, we notified the U.S. government enforcement authorities about
 our internal investigation of the immigration work permit and visa matter and the associated criminal case. We have received and responded to requests from U.S. government authorities related to the matter and to other requests for information about our compliance program.



Other political, economic and social risks that are generally outside of our control and could adversely affect our business include:



·Political risks associated with the relatively recent establishment of the present government and the upcoming presidential election scheduled for November 2011;



·Cancellation or renegotiation of mining contracts by the government;





·Legal and regulatory uncertainties, governmental corruption and bribery;



·Royalty and tax increases or claims by governmental entities, including retroactive claims;



·Security risks due to the remote location in the southern DRC and violence in the northeastern provinces of the DRC;



·Risk of loss of property due to expropriation or nationalization of property; and



·Risk of loss due to civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla activities, insurrection and terrorism.



Consequently, our Tenke Fungurume mining operations and future development projects may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control, any of which could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations.



Terrorist attacks and violence near our operations and throughout the world and the potential for additional future terrorist acts and violence have created economic and political uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our business.



In July 2009, two suicide bombers set off explosions inside of the JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels in Jakarta, Indonesia, that are reported to have killed nine people and injured 53 others. Two of our Indonesian-based executives were injured in the incident.



In July 2009, a small group of individuals created a disturbance on the road leading to our mining and milling operations at our Grasberg mining complex and vandalized vehicles and small buildings. There were no injuries. For more information about a series of shooting incidents near our Grasberg mining complex, see the risk factor “Because our Grasberg minerals district in Papua, Indonesia remains our most significant operating asset, our business may continue to be adversely affected by Indonesian political, economic and social uncertainties” above.



In August 2002, three people were killed and 11 others were wounded in an ambush by a group of unidentified assailants on the road near Tembagapura, the mining town where the majority of PT Freeport Indonesia’s personnel reside. The assailants shot at several vehicles transporting international contract teachers from our school in Tembagapura, their family members and other contractors to PT Freeport Indonesia. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigated the incident, which resulted in the U.S. indictment of an alleged operational commander of the Free Papua Movement/National Freedom Force. In January 2006, Indonesian police, accompanied by FBI agents, arrested the alleged operational commander and 11 other Papuans. In November 2006, verdicts and sentencing were announced for seven of those accused in the August 2002
 shooting, including a life sentence for the confessed leader of the attack.



In October 2002, a bombing killed 202 people in the Indonesian province of Bali, which is 1,500 miles west of our mining and milling operations. Indonesian authorities arrested 35 people in connection with this bombing and 29 of those arrested have been tried and convicted. In August, 2003, 12 people were killed and over 100 were injured by a car bomb detonated outside of the JW Marriott Hotel in Jakarta, Indonesia. In September 2004, 11 people were killed and over 200 injured by a car bomb detonated in front of the Australian embassy in Jakarta. In October 2005, three suicide bombers killed 19 people and wounded over 100 in Bali. The same international terrorist organizations are suspected in each of these incidents. In November 2005, Indonesian police raided a house in East Java that resulted in the death of other accused terr
orists linked to the bombings discussed above. Our mining and milling operations were not interrupted by these incidents, but PT Freeport Indonesia’s corporate office in Jakarta had to relocate for several months following the bombing in front of the Australian embassy. In addition to the Bali, JW Marriott Hotel and Australian embassy bombings, there have been anti-American demonstrations in certain sections of Indonesia reportedly led by radical Islamic activists.



No assurance can be given that additional terrorist incidents and acts of violence will not occur. If there were to be additional violence, it could materially and adversely affect our business in ways that we cannot predict at this time.





Other risks



If market prices for our commodities decline, the carrying values of inventories and long-lived assets may be further impaired, which could require charges to operating income that could be material.



During fourth-quarter 2008, we concluded that the then-current economic environment and significant declines in copper and molybdenum prices represented significant adverse changes in our business requiring us to evaluate our long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment.  As a result, we recorded impairment charges totaling $16.9 billion ($12.6 billion to net loss attributable to common stockholders). Refer to Note 17 for further discussion.



The declines in copper and molybdenum prices in late 2008 also resulted in lower of cost or market (LCM) inventory charges totaling $782 million ($479 million to net loss attributable to common stockholders) in 2008. Additional LCM charges associated with molybdenum inventories totaling $19 million ($15 million to net income attributable to common stockholders) were recorded in first-quarter 2009. We recorded no further LCM inventory adjustments subsequent to first-quarter 2009.



Declines in the market price of copper, among other factors, could cause us to record additional LCM inventory adjustments and could also result in an additional write down of the carrying value of long-lived assets, which would potentially have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and stockholders' equity, but would have no effect on cash flows.



Unanticipated litigation or negative developments in pending litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.



We are a party to the litigation described in Note 13 and in Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” and a number of other litigation matters, including asbestos exposure cases, disputes over the allocation of environmental remediation obligations at Superfund and other sites, disputes over water rights and disputes with regulatory authorities. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us, limitations on our property rights, or regulatory interpretations that increase our operating costs. If any of these disputes results in a substantial monetary judgment against us or an adverse legal interpretation is settled on unfavorable terms, or otherwise affects our operations, it could have a material adverse effect on o
ur operating results and financial condition.



We depend on our senior management team and other key employees, and the loss of any of these employees could adversely affect our business.



Our success depends in part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate senior management and other key employees. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, competitors’ hiring practices, cost reduction activities, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. Competition for qualified personnel can be very intense. We must continue to recruit, retain and motivate senior management and other key employees sufficient to maintain our current business and support our future projects. A loss of such personnel could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities, and our operating results could be adversely affected.



Our holding company structure may impact your ability to receive dividends.



We are a holding company with no material assets other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to repay our indebtedness and pay dividends is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, loan, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to make funds available to us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends. Dividends from subsidiaries that are not wholly owned are shared with other equity owners. In addition, cash at our international operations is subject to foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation into the U.S.



In addition, our subsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends. Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries, may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. Our rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries’ assets upon their liquidation, reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries’ creditors, including any trade creditors.





Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult.



Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult. These provisions:



·Authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and to designate the rights, preferences and privileges of each class; if issued, such preferred stock would increase the number of outstanding shares of our capital stock and could include terms that may deter an acquisition of us;



·Establish advance notice requirements for nominations to the board of directors or for proposals that can be presented at stockholder meetings;



·Limit removal of directors for cause only;



·Limit who may call stockholder meetings; and



·Require the approval of the holders of two thirds of our outstanding common stock to enter into certain business combination transactions, subject to certain exceptions, including if the consideration to be received by our common stockholders in the transaction is deemed to be a fair price.



These provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our board of directors.



In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger with, or acquisition of, us.



These provisions may deter an acquisition of us that might otherwise be attractive to stockholders.
